# Push Notifications Complete Fix - Notifications Work When App is CLOSED

## Your Issue

**"I just get the notification continuously in mobile when the app is opened. When it is closed no notification."**

This is a CRITICAL issue - notifications MUST work when app is closed!

---

## Root Causes (Multiple Issues Fixed)

### Issue 1: Dangerous SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW Permission ‚ùå

**Problem:**
- App requested `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` (Display over other apps)
- Android showed "Access denied" error
- This permission is NOT needed for notifications!

**Fix:** ‚úÖ Removed from both `app.json` and `app.config.js`

### Issue 2: Missing Background Notification Handler ‚ùå CRITICAL

**Problem:**
- NO background task registered to handle notifications when app is CLOSED
- Notification handlers in `_layout.tsx` only work when app is RUNNING
- When app is killed, handlers don't exist, so notifications are ignored!

**This is why notifications only worked when app was open!**

**Fix:** ‚úÖ Created `BackgroundNotificationHandler.ts` and registered task at startup

### Issue 3: Missing POST_NOTIFICATIONS Permission ‚ùå

**Problem:**
- Android 13+ requires explicit `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission
- Was missing from `app.json`

**Fix:** ‚úÖ Added to permissions array

### Issue 4: Incorrect Notification Plugin Config ‚ùå

**Problem:**
- Plugin config didn't specify Android-specific settings
- No default channel configured
- Missing background notification support

**Fix:** ‚úÖ Updated with Android-specific configuration

---

## Complete Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Permissions (app.json & app.config.js)

**Removed:**
- ‚ùå `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` - Dangerous and unnecessary

**Added:**
- ‚úÖ `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Required for Android 13+
- ‚úÖ `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` - For high-priority notifications
- ‚úÖ `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - For notification persistence

**File: app.json**
```json
"permissions": [
  "ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION",
  "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION",
  "ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION",
  "FOREGROUND_SERVICE",
  "FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION",
  "POST_NOTIFICATIONS",           // ‚úÖ Added
  "WAKE_LOCK",
  "USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT",       // ‚úÖ Added
  "REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS",
  "RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"        // ‚úÖ Added
]
```

**File: app.config.js** - Same changes applied

### 2. Updated Notification Plugin Config (app.json)

**Before:**
```json
[
  "expo-notifications",
  {
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",
    "color": "#ffffff",
    "sounds": ["./assets/sounds/notification.mp3"],
    "mode": "production"
  }
]
```

**After:**
```json
[
  "expo-notifications",
  {
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",
    "color": "#10B981",
    "sounds": ["./assets/sounds/notification.mp3"],
    "mode": "production",
    "android": {                                    // ‚úÖ Added Android config
      "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",
      "color": "#10B981",
      "defaultChannel": "ride-requests-urgent"    // ‚úÖ Default channel
    }
  }
]
```

### 3. Added iOS Background Mode (app.json)

**Before:**
```json
"UIBackgroundModes": [
  "location",
  "fetch"
]
```

**After:**
```json
"UIBackgroundModes": [
  "location",
  "fetch",
  "remote-notification"  // ‚úÖ Added for push notifications
]
```

### 4. Created Background Notification Handler ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX

**New File:** `services/BackgroundNotificationHandler.ts`

**Purpose:** Handle notifications when app is CLOSED or in BACKGROUND

**Key Functions:**

```typescript
// Defines the background task that receives notifications
TaskManager.defineTask(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK, async ({ data, error }) => {
  // This runs even when app is CLOSED!
  console.log('üì± Background notification received');
  
  // Notification is automatically displayed by system
  // We just log for debugging
});

// Register the task at app startup
export async function registerBackgroundNotificationTask() {
  await Notifications.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK);
}
```

**Why this is critical:**

```
WITHOUT this:
  App open ‚Üí Notification received ‚Üí Handlers in _layout.tsx run ‚Üí Show notification ‚úÖ
  App closed ‚Üí Notification received ‚Üí NO HANDLERS ‚Üí Ignored ‚ùå

WITH this:
  App open ‚Üí Notification received ‚Üí Handlers run ‚Üí Show notification ‚úÖ
  App closed ‚Üí Notification received ‚Üí Background task wakes app ‚Üí Show notification ‚úÖ
```

### 5. Registered Background Task at Startup (app/_layout.tsx)

**Added:**

```typescript
// Import the handler
import '@/services/BackgroundNotificationHandler';

// Register the task when app starts
useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const { registerBackgroundNotificationTask } = 
      await import('@/services/BackgroundNotificationHandler');
    await registerBackgroundNotificationTask();
  })();
  
  // ... rest of notification setup
}, []);
```

**This ensures the background task is registered IMMEDIATELY when app starts.**

### 6. Fixed User Instructions (services/PushNotificationService.ts)

**Removed confusing instructions about "Display over other apps"**

**Before:**
```typescript
'üì± STEP 2: Enable "Display over other apps"\n' +
'‚Ä¢ Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi ‚Üí Display over other apps\n' +
'‚Ä¢ Tap "Allow restricted settings" at bottom\n'
```

**After:**
```typescript
'üì± Please enable notifications:\n' +
'‚Ä¢ Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí ON\n\n' +
'‚ö†Ô∏è Notifications are required to receive ride alerts!'
```

Simple, clear, correct! ‚úÖ

## How It Works Now

### Notification Flow - App OPEN

```
1. Ride created in admin
   ‚Üì
2. Trigger calls edge function (send-ride-push-notification)
   ‚Üì
3. Edge function sends to Expo Push API
   ‚Üì
4. Expo delivers notification to device
   ‚Üì
5. Device receives notification
   ‚Üì
6. App is OPEN ‚Üí Handlers in _layout.tsx run
   ‚Üì
7. Notification displayed + sound + vibration ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
8. User taps ‚Üí Opens rides tab
```

### Notification Flow - App CLOSED (NEW! ‚úÖ)

```
1. Ride created in admin
   ‚Üì
2. Trigger calls edge function
   ‚Üì
3. Edge function sends to Expo Push API
   ‚Üì
4. Expo delivers notification to device
   ‚Üì
5. Device receives notification
   ‚Üì
6. App is CLOSED ‚Üí Background task wakes up ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
7. TaskManager.defineTask runs ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
8. System displays notification automatically ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
9. Sound + vibration play ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
10. User taps ‚Üí App opens to rides tab ‚úÖ
```

**KEY DIFFERENCE:** Background task handles notifications even when app is completely closed!

## Why Each Fix Was Needed

### SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW Removal

**Why it was there:**
- Mistaken belief it was needed for notifications
- Some old tutorials incorrectly suggest it

**Why it's NOT needed:**
- Overlay permission is for drawing ON TOP of other apps
- Notifications use the system notification tray
- Completely different Android APIs

**Impact of removal:**
- ‚úÖ No more "Access denied" errors
- ‚úÖ Simpler permission request
- ‚úÖ More secure app

### POST_NOTIFICATIONS Permission

**Why it's needed:**
- Android 13+ requires explicit runtime permission
- Without it, notifications are blocked by default

**When it's requested:**
- At runtime when user goes online
- Simple system dialog
- User approves once

### Background Notification Task

**Why it's CRITICAL:**
- When app is closed, no JavaScript code is running
- Notification handlers in _layout.tsx DON'T EXIST
- Without background task, notifications are ignored

**How it works:**
- TaskManager registers task with native code
- Native code stays alive even when app is killed
- When notification arrives, native code wakes up task
- Task runs JavaScript to handle notification

**This is THE KEY FIX for your issue!** ‚úÖ

### USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT Permission

**Why it's needed:**
- Allows high-priority notifications to show as heads-up
- Critical for ride request alerts (like Uber/Ola)
- Shows notification even during Do Not Disturb

### RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED Permission

**Why it's needed:**
- Allows background tasks to restart after device reboot
- Ensures notifications work immediately after restart
- No need to open app first

## What You Need to Do

### STEP 1: Rebuild the APK ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

```bash
# All changes require a new build
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

**Why rebuild is REQUIRED:**
1. Permission changes need new AndroidManifest.xml
2. Background task registration needs native code
3. Plugin configuration changes need new build
4. Old APK still has old permissions and configs

**YOU MUST REBUILD! Old APK won't work!**

### STEP 2: Install New APK

1. Download new APK from EAS
2. Uninstall old app (to clear old permissions)
3. Install new APK
4. Open app

### STEP 3: Test All States

1. **App Open Test:**
   - Open app, go online
   - Create ride
   - Should see notification ‚úÖ

2. **App Background Test:**
   - Open app, go online
   - Press Home button
   - Create ride
   - Should see notification ‚úÖ

3. **App Closed Test (CRITICAL):**
   - Open app, go online
   - Close app completely (swipe away)
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Create ride
   - **Should see notification!** ‚úÖ (This was broken before!)

### STEP 4: Verify Logs

**Check device logs with adb:**

```bash
# Filter for notification logs
adb logcat | grep "notification\|Background notification"
```

**Expected logs when app is CLOSED:**
```
üì± Background notification task triggered
üì® Received background notification: { title: "üöó New Ride Request!", ... }
üöó Ride request notification in background
Ride ID: <ride-id>
Customer: <customer-name>
‚úÖ Background notification task completed
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still not receiving notifications when app is closed

**Check:**
1. Did you rebuild the APK? (Required!)
2. Did you uninstall old app before installing new one?
3. Is `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission granted?
4. Check adb logs for errors

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check if background task is registered
adb logcat | grep "Background notification task"

# Should see:
‚úÖ Background notification task registered successfully
```

### Issue: "Access denied" still appears

**Solution:**
- You're still using old APK
- Old APK has `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`
- Uninstall and install new APK

### Issue: Notifications work sometimes but not always

**Possible causes:**
1. **Battery optimization** - Add app to battery optimization whitelist
2. **Do Not Disturb** - Check DND settings
3. **Notification channel** - Check channel settings in app info
4. **Data saver** - Disable for your app

**Fix:**
```
Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Unrestricted
Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi ‚Üí Mobile data ‚Üí Allow background data
```

### Issue: Sound not playing when app is closed

**Check:**
1. Is device on silent mode?
2. Is notification channel sound enabled?
3. Is notification.mp3 file present in assets?

**Verify notification channel:**
```
Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Ride Requests (Urgent) ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Should be ON
```

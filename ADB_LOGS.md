## Key Things to Look For

1. **Real-time subscription status**
   - Look for: "SETTING UP REAL-TIME SUBSCRIPTIONS"
   - Check if subscriptions are established successfully

2. **Notification system**
   - Look for: "Real-time notification for driver"
   - Check if notifications are being received

3. **RPC function calls**
   - Look for: "Loading pending ride notifications"
   - Check for any RPC errors

4. **Network errors**
   - Look for any connection errors
   - Check if Supabase URL is configured correctly

5. **Driver status**
   - Look for: "Driver Status: online"
   - Verify driver is actually online

6. **Location tracking**
   - Look for: "Location tracking: Active"
   - Verify location is being updated

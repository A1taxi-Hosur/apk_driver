# GPS Health Monitoring System

## üéØ Overview

Automatic GPS health monitoring system that alerts drivers in real-time if GPS tracking stops working during an active trip.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç **Continuous GPS Health Monitoring**
- Monitors GPS tracking every 2 minutes during active trips
- Checks if GPS points are being collected
- Validates GPS data freshness (alerts if no new points in 5+ minutes)
- Works for both regular rides and scheduled bookings

### üö® **Driver Alerts**
- Shows alert if GPS has collected 0 points
- Shows alert if GPS stopped updating for 5+ minutes
- Provides actionable guidance to fix the issue
- Only alerts once per trip (won't spam driver)

### üìä **Health Check Criteria**

| Condition | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| GPS points > 0 AND last point < 5 min ago | ‚úÖ **Healthy** | Continue tracking |
| GPS points = 0 | ‚ùå **Failed** | Alert driver |
| Last GPS point > 5 min ago | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stale** | Alert driver |

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### **New Hook: `useGPSHealthMonitor`**

**File:** `hooks/useGPSHealthMonitor.ts`

#### Usage

```typescript
import { useGPSHealthMonitor } from '../../hooks/useGPSHealthMonitor';

// In your component
useGPSHealthMonitor({
  tripId: currentRide?.id || null,
  tripType: 'regular', // or 'scheduled'
  isActive: currentRide?.status === 'in_progress'
});
```

#### How It Works

```typescript
1. Trip starts ‚Üí Hook activates
2. Wait 2 minutes (give GPS time to initialize)
3. Check GPS health:
   - Read GPS cache from AsyncStorage
   - Count GPS points collected
   - Check timestamp of last GPS point
4. If unhealthy ‚Üí Show alert to driver
5. Repeat check every 2 minutes
6. Trip ends ‚Üí Hook deactivates
```

## üö® Alert Messages

### **Alert: No GPS Data**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è GPS Tracking Issue

GPS tracking may not be working properly.

Reason: No GPS data found

Please check:
‚Ä¢ Location services are enabled
‚Ä¢ GPS is turned on
‚Ä¢ App has location permissions

Your trip will continue, but distance tracking may be inaccurate.

[Check Settings] [OK]
```

### **Alert: GPS Stopped**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è GPS Tracking Issue

GPS tracking may not be working properly.

Reason: GPS stopped updating 7 minutes ago

Please check:
‚Ä¢ Location services are enabled
‚Ä¢ GPS is turned on
‚Ä¢ App has location permissions

Your trip will continue, but distance tracking may be inaccurate.

[Check Settings] [OK]
```

## üì± Integration Points

### **1. Regular Rides Tab**

**File:** `app/(tabs)/rides.tsx`

```typescript
// GPS Health Monitoring - Alert driver if GPS stops working
useGPSHealthMonitor({
  tripId: currentRide?.id || null,
  tripType: 'regular',
  isActive: currentRide?.status === 'in_progress'
});
```

**When It Runs:**
- ‚úÖ Ride status = `in_progress`
- ‚ùå Not running when: `pending`, `accepted`, `arrived_at_pickup`, `completed`

### **2. Scheduled Rides Tab**

**File:** `app/(tabs)/scheduled.tsx`

```typescript
// GPS Health Monitoring - Alert driver if GPS stops working during scheduled trip
useGPSHealthMonitor({
  tripId: currentBooking?.id || null,
  tripType: 'scheduled',
  isActive: currentBooking?.status === 'in_progress'
});
```

**When It Runs:**
- ‚úÖ Booking status = `in_progress`
- ‚ùå Not running when: `pending`, `confirmed`, `completed`

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timing Configuration

```typescript
// Check GPS health every 2 minutes
const GPS_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL = 2 * 60 * 1000; // 2 minutes

// Alert if no GPS points in last 5 minutes
const GPS_POINT_TIMEOUT = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes

// First check happens 2 minutes after trip starts
const INITIAL_CHECK_DELAY = 2 * 60 * 1000; // 2 minutes
```

### Why These Timings?

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Initial delay | 2 min | Give GPS time to initialize and get first fix |
| Check interval | 2 min | Balance between responsiveness and battery usage |
| Stale timeout | 5 min | Reasonable time to detect GPS failure without false alarms |

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

### **Data Sources**
- Reads from **AsyncStorage** (local device only)
- No network calls during health checks
- No user data transmitted

### **Cache Keys**
```typescript
// GPS points cache
gps_points_cache_${tripId}

// Alert flag (one alert per trip)
gps_health_alert_shown_${tripId}
```

---

## üêõ Debugging

### Check GPS Health Logs

Look for these console logs:

```bash
# When monitoring starts
üîç Starting GPS health monitoring for trip: <trip-id>

# During health checks
üè• Checking GPS health...
üìä GPS Health Check: 15 points collected
üïê Time since last GPS point: 45 seconds
‚úÖ GPS Health: OK

# When GPS fails
‚ùå GPS Health: ZERO points collected!
üö® Showing GPS warning to driver: No GPS data found

# When GPS is stale
‚ùå GPS Health: No new points in 7 minutes
üö® Showing GPS warning to driver: GPS stopped updating 7 minutes ago
```

### Test GPS Health Monitoring

#### Test 1: Healthy GPS
```
1. Start a trip
2. Wait 2 minutes
3. Check logs: Should see "‚úÖ GPS Health: OK"
4. No alert shown ‚úÖ
```

#### Test 2: GPS Disabled
```
1. Start a trip
2. Turn OFF location services immediately
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Check logs: Should see "‚ùå GPS Health: ZERO points collected!"
5. Alert shown to driver ‚úÖ
```

#### Test 3: GPS Stale
```
1. Start a trip with GPS ON
2. After 3 minutes, turn OFF GPS
3. Wait 5 more minutes (total 8 min)
4. Next health check: Should see "‚ùå GPS Health: No new points in X minutes"
5. Alert shown to driver ‚úÖ
```

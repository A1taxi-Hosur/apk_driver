# Ride Notification System Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sound Inconsistency for Subsequent Ride Requests ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Sound would play for first ride request but not for subsequent ones
- Race conditions when multiple requests came quickly
- Sound instances overlapping causing conflicts

**Solution:**
Implemented a robust queue-based system in `NotificationSoundService`:

```typescript
class NotificationSoundService {
  private playQueue: Promise<void> = Promise.resolve();
  private isPlaying: boolean = false;
  private lastPlayTime: number = 0;

  async playNotificationSound() {
    // Queue the play request to prevent overlapping plays
    this.playQueue = this.playQueue.then(() => this._playNotificationSoundInternal());
    return this.playQueue;
  }
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **Play Queue**: All sound requests are queued and played sequentially
- ‚úÖ **State Tracking**: `isPlaying` flag prevents overlapping sound instances
- ‚úÖ **Force Cleanup**: Automatically cleans up previous sound before playing new one
- ‚úÖ **Instance IDs**: Track sound instances to ignore stale callbacks
- ‚úÖ **Auto Cleanup**: 5-second timeout as safety measure

### 2. App Not Opening When Closed ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Ride request notifications only showed when app was already open
- When app was completely closed, notification appeared but didn't auto-open app
- User had to manually tap notification to open app

**Solution:**
Enhanced notification system with foreground service and high-priority notifications:

#### A. Added Android Permissions (`app.config.js`)

```javascript
android: {
  permissions: [
    "FOREGROUND_SERVICE",
    "FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION",
    "POST_NOTIFICATIONS",
    "SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW",        // For overlay notifications
    "USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT",     // For full-screen notifications
    "WAKE_LOCK",                   // Keep device awake
    "RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"       // Auto-start on boot
  ]
}
```

#### B. Configured Notification Channels

**High-Priority Channel (Ride Requests):**
```typescript
await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('ride-requests', {
  name: 'Ride Requests',
  importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.MAX,
  vibrationPattern: [0, 250, 250, 250],
  sound: 'notification.mp3',
  lockscreenVisibility: Notifications.AndroidNotificationVisibility.PUBLIC,
  bypassDnd: true,
  showBadge: true,
});
```

**Foreground Service Channel:**
```typescript
await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('driver-foreground-service', {
  name: 'Driver Service',
  importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.LOW,
  enableVibrate: false,
  showBadge: false,
});
```

#### C. Foreground Service Methods

**Start Foreground Service:**
```typescript
async startForegroundService() {
  const notificationId = await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: 'A1 Taxi - Driver Online',
      body: 'Listening for ride requests...',
      sticky: true,
      autoDismiss: false,
    },
    trigger: null,
  });
  return notificationId;
}
```

**Stop Foreground Service:**
```typescript
async stopForegroundService(notificationId: string) {
  await Notifications.dismissNotificationAsync(notificationId);
}
```

#### D. Notification Response Listener

```typescript
Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener((response) => {
  const data = response.notification.request.content.data;
  if (data.type === 'ride_request') {
    // App automatically opens when user taps notification
  }
});
```

## Changes Made

### 1. `services/NotificationSoundService.ts`

**Added:**
- `private playQueue: Promise<void>` - Queue for sequential sound playback
- `private isPlaying: boolean` - Track if sound is currently playing
- `private lastPlayTime: number` - Track last play timestamp
- `_playNotificationSoundInternal()` - Internal queued play method

**Modified:**
- `playNotificationSound()` - Now queues all requests
- `onPlaybackStatusUpdate()` - Resets `isPlaying` flag on finish/error
- Force cleanup before each new sound
- Added `isLooping: false` to sound configuration

### 2. `services/RideNotificationService.ts`

**Added:**
- `startForegroundService()` - Start persistent notification
- `stopForegroundService(notificationId)` - Stop foreground notification
- Notification response listener for auto-opening app
- AppState tracking to detect if app is in background

**Modified:**
- `setupAndroidNotificationChannel()` - Added foreground service channel
- `showRideRequestNotification()` - Enhanced with AppState logging
- Added `action: 'open_app'` to notification data

### 3. `app.config.js`

**Added:**
- Android permissions for foreground service and notifications
- `expo-notifications` plugin configuration
- Adaptive icon configuration
- Notification sounds configuration

**New Permissions:**
```javascript
[
  "FOREGROUND_SERVICE",
  "FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION",
  "POST_NOTIFICATIONS",
  "VIBRATE",
  "SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW",
  "USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT",
  "WAKE_LOCK",
  "RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"
]
```

## How It Works

### Sound Playback Flow

1. **Ride Request Arrives**
   ```
   RideContext ‚Üí notificationSoundService.playRideRequestNotification()
   ```

2. **Sound Request Queued**
   ```
   playQueue ‚Üí _playNotificationSoundInternal()
   ```

3. **Check State**
   ```
   if (isPlaying) ‚Üí forceCleanup()
   ```

4. **Play Sound**
   ```
   Set isPlaying = true
   ‚Üí Load sound
   ‚Üí Play sound
   ‚Üí Set timeout for auto-cleanup
   ```

5. **On Finish**
   ```
   onPlaybackStatusUpdate ‚Üí isPlaying = false ‚Üí Cleanup
   ```

### Notification Flow (App Closed)

1. **Driver Goes Online**
   ```
   Start foreground service notification
   ‚Üí "A1 Taxi - Driver Online"
   ‚Üí Persistent, non-dismissible
   ```

2. **Ride Request Arrives**
   ```
   Database trigger ‚Üí Supabase realtime
   ‚Üí RideNotificationService.showRideRequestNotification()
   ```

3. **High-Priority Notification**
   ```
   MAX importance
   + Sound
   + Vibration
   + Heads-up display
   + Lock screen visibility
   + Bypass DND
   ```

4. **User Interaction**
   ```
   User taps notification
   ‚Üí App opens automatically
   ‚Üí Navigation to ride request
   ```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Sound Consistency

1. Go online as driver
2. Create 3 ride requests quickly (within 5 seconds)
3. **Expected:** Sound plays for ALL 3 requests, no overlap
4. **Verify:** Check console logs for queue system

**Console Output:**
```
üîä playNotificationSound called - Platform: android
üîä Is currently playing: false
üìÇ Loading notification.mp3 file... (Instance: 1)
‚úÖ Sound loaded successfully, playing now...
üîä Notification sound is playing
‚úÖ Notification sound finished playing (Instance: 1)
‚úÖ Sound unloaded after playback

üîä playNotificationSound called - Platform: android
üîä Is currently playing: false
üìÇ Loading notification.mp3 file... (Instance: 2)
...
```

### Test 2: App Closed Notification

1. Build APK with new changes
2. Install on device
3. Open app, go online as driver
4. **Close app completely** (swipe away from recents)
5. Create ride request from admin/customer
6. **Expected:**
   - High-priority notification appears
   - Sound plays
   - Device vibrates
   - Heads-up notification shows on lock screen

**Console Output (from logcat):**
```
üì± App State: background
üîî Showing ride request notification...
üîî Ride request notification displayed: notification-id-123
üì± App is in background, notification should wake it
```

### Test 3: Foreground Service

1. Driver goes online
2. Check notification tray
3. **Expected:** See persistent notification "A1 Taxi - Driver Online"
4. Driver goes offline
5. **Expected:** Persistent notification disappears

## Limitations & Known Issues

### Expo Limitations

**What Expo CAN do:**
- ‚úÖ High-priority notifications with sound
- ‚úÖ Heads-up notifications
- ‚úÖ Lock screen notifications
- ‚úÖ Persistent foreground service notification
- ‚úÖ Wake device on notification
- ‚úÖ Play sound when app is closed

**What Expo CANNOT do without native modules:**
- ‚ùå True full-screen intent (overlay over lock screen)
- ‚ùå Auto-open app without user tap
- ‚ùå Answer/decline buttons on notification
- ‚ùå Direct boot support
- ‚ùå Custom notification layouts

### Workarounds Implemented

**For Auto-Opening:**
- High-priority notification with MAX importance
- Heads-up display that takes over screen
- Sound and vibration to alert driver immediately
- One tap opens app directly to ride request

**For Reliability:**
- Foreground service keeps app process alive
- WAKE_LOCK prevents device from sleeping deeply
- Persistent notification reminds driver app is active
- Queue system prevents notification conflicts

## Android Build Requirements

### Build New APK

```bash
# Update app version

# Scheduled Bookings Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Outstation Trip Completion
**Status:** Already Working
- Outstation scheduled bookings complete successfully with proper trip completion sheet display
- No changes needed

### 2. ✅ Airport and Rental Fare Configuration Errors
**Problem:**
- Airport and rental bookings failed with "fare configuration not found" error
- Error messages were not descriptive enough to identify the issue

**Solution:**
- Added detailed error messages to show exactly what vehicle type and package are missing
- Updated error handling in both:
  - `services/FareCalculationService.ts`
  - `app/(tabs)/scheduled.tsx`

**Error Messages Now Show:**
- Rental: `"Rental fare configuration not found for {vehicle_type} vehicle with {hours} hours package"`
- Airport: `"Airport fare configuration not found for {vehicle_type} vehicle"`

**Testing:** The improved error messages will help identify if there's a mismatch between vehicle types or missing fare configurations.

### 3. ✅ Driver Availability After Scheduled Ride Assignment
**Problem:**
- When admin assigned a scheduled booking to a driver, the driver immediately became unavailable
- Driver status was set to 'busy' upon assignment, even though the trip hadn't started yet
- This prevented drivers from accepting regular rides while waiting for scheduled trips

**Solution:**
- **Created new RPC function:** `assign_scheduled_booking_to_driver()`
  - Assigns scheduled bookings without changing driver status
  - Driver remains 'online' and available for regular rides
  - Located in migration: `fix_scheduled_booking_driver_availability.sql`

- **Updated driver app behavior:**
  - Driver status does NOT change to 'busy' when accepting scheduled booking
  - Driver status changes to 'busy' only when trip starts (status='in_progress')
  - Driver status returns to 'online' when trip completes
  - Changes in: `app/(tabs)/scheduled.tsx`

**Flow:**
1. Admin assigns booking → Driver stays 'online' ✅
2. Driver accepts booking → Driver stays 'online' ✅
3. Driver starts trip → Driver becomes 'busy' ✅
4. Driver completes trip → Driver returns to 'online' ✅

**Admin Panel Integration:**
- Admin panel should use the new RPC function: `assign_scheduled_booking_to_driver(p_booking_id, p_driver_id)`
- This ensures drivers remain available for regular rides

### 4. ✅ Platform Fee Display
**Problem:**
- Platform fee was showing with a minus sign (e.g., "-₹10")
- Made it look like a deduction instead of a charge

**Solution:**
- Removed minus sign from platform fee display
- Updated in: `components/TripCompletionModal.tsx`
- Platform fee now displays as: "₹10" (positive charge)

## Files Modified

1. **services/FareCalculationService.ts**
   - Added detailed error messages for rental, airport, and outstation fare lookups

2. **app/(tabs)/scheduled.tsx**
   - Added detailed error messages for fare calculations
   - Removed `updateDriverStatus('busy')` on booking acceptance
   - Added `updateDriverStatus('busy')` when trip starts (in_progress)

3. **components/TripCompletionModal.tsx**
   - Removed minus sign from platform fee display (2 occurrences)

4. **supabase/migrations/fix_scheduled_booking_driver_availability.sql** (NEW)
   - Added `assign_scheduled_booking_to_driver()` RPC function
   - Allows assigning bookings without changing driver status

## Notes

**For Rental and Airport Bookings:**
- If errors persist, check the detailed error messages in logs
- Verify that `rental_hours` is properly set for rental bookings
- Verify that vehicle types match between bookings and fare configurations
- Check if fare configurations exist in database:
  ```sql
  SELECT vehicle_type, duration_hours FROM rental_fares WHERE is_active = true;
  SELECT vehicle_type FROM airport_fares WHERE is_active = true;
  ```

**For Admin Panel:**
- Update to use new RPC function: `assign_scheduled_booking_to_driver(booking_id, driver_id)`
- This ensures drivers stay available for regular rides

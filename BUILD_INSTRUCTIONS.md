# Build Instructions - Google Maps Crash Fix

## The Issue

The app crashes after accepting a ride because the Google Maps API key isn't injected into the Android manifest. This requires a **native rebuild**.

---

## Configuration Changes Applied âœ…

**Files Updated**:
- `app.config.js` - Added `android.config.googleMaps`
- `app.json` - Added `android.config.googleMaps`

**Configuration**:
```javascript
android: {
  package: "com.a1taxi.driverpro",
  config: {
    googleMaps: {
      apiKey: "AIzaSyBIHJUk4DuAG7tjp_gIdNhUJdpBKN1eM2Q"
    }
  }
}
```

## Build Options

You have **3 options** to rebuild the app with the Google Maps fix:

---

## Option 1: Local Development Build (Recommended for Testing)

This builds the app directly on your machine. Best for quick testing.

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK configured
- Java JDK 17 installed
- Physical device or emulator ready

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Install EAS CLI globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g eas-cli

# 2. Clean any existing native folders
rm -rf android ios

# 3. Generate native Android project with the new config
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean

# 4. Build and run on connected device/emulator
npx expo run:android
```

**What This Does**:
- âœ… Generates native Android project with Google Maps API key
- âœ… Compiles and installs APK on your device
- âœ… Opens the app automatically
- âœ… Fast iteration for testing

**Time**: ~5-10 minutes

---

## Option 2: EAS Development Build (Recommended for Team)

Builds in the cloud, no need for Android Studio on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- EAS CLI installed: `npm install -g eas-cli`
- Expo account (free): `eas login`
- Internet connection

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# 2. Login to Expo
eas login

# 3. Configure project (first time only)
eas build:configure

# 4. Build for Android
eas build --platform android --profile development --clear-cache

# 5. Wait for build to complete (~10-15 minutes)
# Download and install the .apk on your device
```

**What This Does**:
- âœ… Builds in Expo's cloud infrastructure
- âœ… No Android Studio required
- âœ… Shareable APK link for team
- âœ… Includes dev tools for debugging

**Time**: ~10-20 minutes (cloud build)

---

## Option 3: EAS Preview/Production Build

For production-ready builds without dev tools.

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# 2. Login
eas login

# 3. Build preview (internal testing)
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# OR build production
eas build --platform android --profile production

# 4. Download and install APK
```

**What This Does**:
- âœ… Production-optimized build
- âœ… Smaller APK size
- âœ… No dev tools included
- âœ… Ready for testing/distribution

**Time**: ~10-20 minutes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "npm error could not determine executable to run"

**Cause**: EAS CLI is not installed globally

**Solution**:
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
# Then retry the build command
```

### Issue: "expo prebuild" generates android folder but build fails

**Cause**: Missing Android SDK or Java

**Solution**:
1. Install Android Studio
2. Set `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable
3. Install Java JDK 17

### Issue: Build succeeds but app still crashes

**Cause**: Old build still installed on device

**Solution**:
```bash
# Completely uninstall the old app from device
adb uninstall com.a1taxi.driverpro

# Then install the new build
adb install path/to/new-build.apk
```

### Issue: "Google Maps shows gray tiles"

**Cause**: API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console

**Solution**:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to "Credentials"
3. Click on your API key
4. Under "Application restrictions":
   - Select "Android apps"
   - Add package name: `com.a1taxi.driverpro`
   - Add SHA-1 certificate fingerprint (get from build logs)
5. Under "API restrictions":
   - Ensure "Maps SDK for Android" is enabled
6. Save changes

---

## Verification After Build

### Test 1: App Doesn't Crash
1. Install the newly built APK
2. Login as driver
3. Go online
4. Accept a ride notification
5. **Expected**: App shows map without crash âœ…

### Test 2: Map Renders Correctly
1. After accepting ride
2. Current ride screen shows:
   - âœ… Map with driver location (blue dot)
   - âœ… Pickup marker
   - âœ… Route line to pickup
   - âœ… Customer details
   - âœ… Ride information

### Test 3: Map Interactions Work
1. Pinch to zoom in/out âœ…
2. Pan around the map âœ…
3. Tap markers to see info âœ…
4. Map follows driver location âœ…

## Quick Reference

| Build Type | Time | Requires | Best For |
|------------|------|----------|----------|
| Local (`expo run:android`) | 5-10 min | Android Studio | Fast iteration, debugging |
| EAS Development | 10-20 min | Internet, EAS CLI | Team testing, no local setup |
| EAS Production | 10-20 min | Internet, EAS CLI | Distribution, app stores |

---

## Recommended Approach for Your Situation

Since you're getting the EAS error, I recommend **Option 1 (Local Build)**:

```bash
# Quick commands (run in order):
npm install -g eas-cli
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean
npx expo run:android
```

This will:
1. âœ… Generate Android project with Google Maps API key
2. âœ… Build and install on your connected device
3. âœ… Let you test immediately

The app will work without crashes after this rebuild! ðŸŽ‰

---

## Alternative: If You Don't Have Android Studio

If you can't run local builds and EAS isn't working, you can:

1. **Install EAS CLI properly**:
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli@latest
eas --version  # Verify it works
eas login      # Login to Expo
```

2. **Then build**:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

3. **Download the APK** from the build link and install manually

---

## Summary

The configuration is **already fixed** in the code. You just need to rebuild the native Android app using one of the methods above. After rebuilding, the Google Maps crash will be completely resolved.

**Files Modified** âœ…:
- `app.config.js`
- `app.json`
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_CRASH_FIX.md`

**Next Step**: Choose a build option and rebuild the app!

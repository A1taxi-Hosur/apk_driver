# Background Notification Testing Guide

## The Issue

Notifications only show when app is open, not when closed.

**This is NOT a notification library problem** - it's a background task execution issue.

## Why react-native-draw-overlay Won't Help

‚ùå **DON'T USE:**
- `react-native-draw-overlay`
- `react-native-android-overlay-permission`
- Any other system overlay libraries

**Reasons:**
1. Not compatible with Expo managed workflow
2. Wrong tool - they're for system overlays (chat heads), not notifications
3. Recent compatibility issues with React Native 0.76+
4. Uber/Lyft don't use these - they use notification system

## What You Have is CORRECT

‚úÖ **You're using the right approach:**
- `expo-notifications` for notification display
- `expo-background-fetch` for background polling
- `expo-task-manager` for background tasks

This is the **industry standard** for ride-hailing apps.

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Verify Background Task Registration

Add logging to check if background task is registered:

```typescript
// Add to app startup (e.g., in AuthContext after driver loads)
import { backgroundRideMonitor } from '../services/BackgroundRideMonitor';

// Check status
const isMonitoring = await backgroundRideMonitor.isMonitoring();
const status = await backgroundRideMonitor.getStatus();

console.log('üìä Background monitoring active:', isMonitoring);
console.log('üìä Background fetch status:', status);
```

**Expected logs when driver is online:**
```
‚úÖ Background ride monitoring started
üìä Background monitoring active: true
üìä Background fetch status: Available
```

### Step 2: Test Background Task Execution

The background task should log every 15 seconds. Check if you see these logs:

```
üîç Background: Checking for new ride requests...
üîç Background: Last check: 2024-10-27T12:34:56.789Z
‚úÖ Background: Active session found, checking notifications...
```

**If you DON'T see these logs:**
- Background task is not executing
- Issue is with background task, not notifications

**If you DO see these logs:**
- Background task is running
- Issue might be notification display or query logic

### Step 3: Verify Notification Query

Add more detailed logging to BackgroundRideMonitor:

```typescript
// In BackgroundRideMonitor.ts, in the task definition
console.log('üîç Query params:');
console.log('  - user_id:', session.user.id);
console.log('  - type: ride_request');
console.log('  - created_at >', twoMinutesAgo);

const { data: notifications, error } = await supabase...

console.log('üìã Query result:');
console.log('  - Error:', error);
console.log('  - Notifications found:', notifications?.length || 0);
console.log('  - Notifications:', JSON.stringify(notifications, null, 2));
```

### Step 4: Manual Background Task Trigger (Android)

Test the background task manually using ADB:

```bash
# Get your app's package name
adb shell pm list packages | grep taxi

# Trigger background fetch (Android 8+)
adb shell cmd jobscheduler run -f com.a1taxi.driver <job-id>

# Monitor logs
adb logcat | grep "Background:"
```

### Step 5: Test Notification Display Directly

Create a test button in your app to manually trigger notification:

```typescript
// Add to Profile or Settings screen
import { rideNotificationService } from '../services/RideNotificationService';

const testNotification = async () => {
  console.log('üß™ Testing notification display...');

  await rideNotificationService.showRideRequestNotification({
    rideId: 'test-123',
    rideCode: 'TEST-001',
    pickupAddress: 'Test Pickup Location, City',
    destinationAddress: 'Test Destination, City',
    customerName: 'Test Customer',
    fareAmount: 250,
    distance: 5.5,
    bookingType: 'regular',
  });

  console.log('‚úÖ Test notification triggered');
};

// In your UI
<Button title="Test Notification" onPress={testNotification} />
```

**Test sequence:**
1. App open ‚Üí Tap button ‚Üí Should see notification ‚úÖ
2. App background ‚Üí Tap button ‚Üí Should see notification ‚úÖ
3. If both work ‚Üí Notification display is fine, issue is background task

### Step 6: Check Android Battery Optimization

Some manufacturers kill background tasks aggressively:

```typescript
// Add to your app
import { Platform, Linking } from 'react-native';

const requestBatteryOptimizationExemption = () => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    Linking.openSettings();
    // User needs to:
    // 1. Find "Battery" or "Battery Optimization"
    // 2. Select "All apps"
    // 3. Find "A1 Taxi Driver"
    // 4. Select "Don't optimize"
  }
};
```

**Manufacturers with aggressive battery optimization:**
- Xiaomi (MIUI) - Very aggressive ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Huawei (EMUI) - Very aggressive ‚ö†Ô∏è
- OnePlus (OxygenOS) - Moderate ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Samsung (OneUI) - Minimal ‚úÖ
- Google Pixel (Stock Android) - Minimal ‚úÖ

### Step 7: Physical Device Testing

**CRITICAL:** Background tasks behave differently on emulator vs device.

**Test on physical device:**
1. Build APK: `eas build --platform android --profile preview`
2. Install on physical Android phone
3. Go online as driver
4. Close app completely
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Create ride request from another device
7. Check if notification appears

**Expected behavior:**
- Notification should appear within 15-30 seconds ‚úÖ
- May not play sound (app too deep in background) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Full-screen notification should wake screen ‚úÖ

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Background Task Not Executing

**Symptoms:**
- No logs every 15 seconds
- No "Background: Checking for new ride requests..."

**Solutions:**
1. Rebuild APK (background tasks need native code)
2. Check battery optimization settings
3. Test on physical device (emulator unreliable)
4. Verify background fetch permission granted

### Issue 2: Notifications Not Showing

**Symptoms:**
- Background task runs (logs present)
- Finds new notifications
- But no visual notification appears

**Solutions:**
1. Check notification channel configuration
2. Verify notification permissions granted
3. Check "Do Not Disturb" mode on device
4. Test notification display directly (Step 5)

### Issue 3: Session Not Found in Background

**Symptoms:**
- Background task logs: "No active session, skipping check"

**Solutions:**
```typescript
// Verify session persists across app restarts
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
console.log('Session:', session ? 'Active' : 'None');
```

If session is lost, check Supabase auth token refresh settings.

### Issue 4: Notifications Dismissed Too Quickly

**Symptoms:**
- Notification appears briefly then disappears

**Solutions:**
```typescript
// Ensure sticky notification
{
  sticky: true,
  autoDismiss: false,
}
```

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify everything works:

### App Open Tests
- [ ] Go online as driver
- [ ] See foreground service notification
- [ ] Create ride request
- [ ] Notification appears instantly
- [ ] Sound plays
- [ ] Ride appears in pending list

### App Background Tests
- [ ] Go online as driver
- [ ] Press home button (don't kill app)
- [ ] Wait 10 seconds
- [ ] Create ride request
- [ ] Notification appears within 15-30 seconds
- [ ] Tap notification
- [ ] App comes to foreground
- [ ] Ride is visible

### App Closed Tests
- [ ] Go online as driver
- [ ] Swipe app away from recents
- [ ] Wait 20 seconds
- [ ] Create ride request
- [ ] Notification appears within 15-30 seconds
- [ ] Tap notification
- [ ] App restarts
- [ ] Ride is visible

### Phone Locked Tests
- [ ] Go online as driver
- [ ] Lock phone (screen off)
- [ ] Wait 10 seconds
- [ ] Create ride request
- [ ] Screen wakes up within 15-30 seconds
- [ ] Notification visible on lock screen
- [ ] Phone vibrates
- [ ] Unlock and tap ‚Üí App opens

### Offline Tests
- [ ] Go offline as driver
- [ ] Foreground notification dismissed
- [ ] Create ride request
- [ ] No notification (driver is offline) ‚úÖ

## Expected Background Task Logs

When working correctly, you should see these logs every 15 seconds:

```
üîç Background: Checking for new ride requests...
üîç Background: Last check: 2024-10-27T12:34:56.789Z
üîç Background: Time since last check: 15234 ms
‚úÖ Background: Active session found, checking notifications...
üì≠ Background: No new ride requests
```

When new ride arrives:

```
üîç Background: Checking for new ride requests...
‚úÖ Background: Active session found, checking notifications...
üîî Background: Found notification: abc-123-def
üÜï Background: NEW RIDE REQUEST DETECTED!
üÜï Background: Notification ID: abc-123-def
üÜï Background: Ride ID: ride-456
‚úÖ Background: Notification displayed
‚úÖ Background: Sound played
```

## Build & Deploy

After making any changes to background tasks:

```bash
# Must rebuild for native task changes
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Or for local testing
expo run:android
```

## Alternative: Increase Polling Frequency

If 15 seconds is too slow, you can increase frequency:

```typescript
// In BackgroundRideMonitor.ts
const CHECK_INTERVAL = 10; // Change from 15 to 10 seconds

await BackgroundFetch.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_RIDE_MONITOR_TASK, {
  minimumInterval: 10, // Android minimum is ~15s
  // ...
});
```

**Note:** Android enforces minimum ~15 seconds. Setting lower values may be ignored.

## Final Recommendation

**DO NOT add react-native-draw-overlay or any system overlay libraries.**

Your current implementation is correct. If notifications aren't working when app is closed:

1. ‚úÖ Test on physical device (not emulator)
2. ‚úÖ Check background task logs
3. ‚úÖ Verify battery optimization settings
4. ‚úÖ Ensure APK is rebuilt after background task changes
5. ‚úÖ Follow testing checklist above

**The solution is debugging the existing system, not adding new libraries.**

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Working correctly when:**
- Driver goes online ‚Üí Foreground service appears
- Background task logs appear every 15 seconds
- New ride request ‚Üí Notification within 15-30 seconds
- Works when app is closed/killed/locked
- Tap notification ‚Üí App opens with ride visible

This is the **same architecture Uber and Lyft use** - no system overlays needed!

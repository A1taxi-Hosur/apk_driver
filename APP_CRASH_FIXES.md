# App Crash Fixes - Consistency & Stability Improvements

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Memory Leaks in RideContext ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- `setupRealTimeSubscriptions()` created Supabase channel subscriptions but the cleanup function was NEVER called
- `setInterval` running every 2 seconds could pile up if previous `loadRides()` calls were still running
- Real-time subscriptions would accumulate each time the component re-rendered

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Memory leak - cleanup function not stored or called
useEffect(() => {
  setupRealTimeSubscriptions() // Returns cleanup but ignored!
  const refreshInterval = setInterval(() => loadRides(), 2000)
  return () => {
    clearInterval(refreshInterval)
  }
}, [driver])

// AFTER: Proper cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = setupRealTimeSubscriptions() // Store cleanup
  const refreshInterval = setInterval(() => loadRides(), 2000)
  return () => {
    clearInterval(refreshInterval)
    if (unsubscribe) unsubscribe() // Call cleanup!
  }
}, [driver])
```

**Impact:** Prevented accumulating Supabase subscriptions that would eventually crash the app

---

### 2. Race Conditions in loadRides() ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- `loadRides()` was called every 2 seconds without checking if previous call finished
- Multiple concurrent async operations updating the same state
- Could cause state corruption and crashes

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Added concurrency control
const [isLoadingRides, setIsLoadingRides] = useState(false)

const loadRides = async () => {
  if (isLoadingRides) {
    console.log('‚è∏Ô∏è loadRides already in progress, skipping...')
    return
  }

  try {
    setIsLoadingRides(true)
    // ... load rides
  } finally {
    setIsLoadingRides(false)
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Prevented race conditions that could corrupt application state

---

### 3. Unmounted Component State Updates ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Async functions (`loadRides`, `handleNotificationUpdate`) updating state after component unmounted
- Classic React error: "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component"
- Causes memory leaks and potential crashes

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Added mounted ref to track component lifecycle
const isMountedRef = React.useRef(true)

useEffect(() => {
  isMountedRef.current = true

  return () => {
    isMountedRef.current = false // Mark as unmounted
  }
}, [driver])

// Check before all state updates
const loadRides = async () => {
  if (!isMountedRef.current) return

  const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_driver_current_ride', {...})

  if (isMountedRef.current) { // Check before setState
    setCurrentRide(ride)
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Eliminated warnings and potential crashes from updating unmounted components

---

### 4. Missing Cleanup in LocationContext ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- `setInterval` for web-based location tracking didn't have proper cleanup on unmount
- Location subscriptions could leak if component unmounted during async operations

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Added isMountedRef pattern
const isMountedRef = React.useRef(true)

// Safe state setters
const safeSetCurrentLocation = (location) => {
  if (isMountedRef.current) setCurrentLocation(location)
}

useEffect(() => {
  isMountedRef.current = true

  return () => {
    isMountedRef.current = false
    // Clean up location tracking
    if (locationSubscription) {
      locationSubscription.remove()
    }
  }
}, [])
```

**Impact:** Prevented memory leaks from location tracking services

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `contexts/RideContext.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `isMountedRef` to track component lifecycle

- ‚úÖ Added mounted checks before all state updates in `loadRides()`
- ‚úÖ Added mounted checks in `setInterval` callback
- ‚úÖ Proper cleanup of all resources on unmount

**Lines Changed:** ~30 lines modified, ~10 lines added

---

### 2. `contexts/LocationContext.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `isMountedRef` to track component lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Created safe state setter functions:
  - `safeSetCurrentLocation()`
  - `safeSetCurrentAddress()`
  - `safeSetLocationPermission()`
  - `safeSetIsTracking()`
- ‚úÖ Added location subscription cleanup on unmount
- ‚úÖ All state updates wrapped in mounted checks

**Lines Changed:** ~15 lines added

## How These Fixes Prevent Crashes

### Before Fixes:
1. **App opens** ‚Üí Creates RideContext
2. **Driver logs in** ‚Üí Starts location tracking, real-time subscriptions, 2s interval
3. **Driver navigates away** ‚Üí Component unmounts but:
   - ‚ùå Real-time subscriptions still active
   - ‚ùå Location updates still running
   - ‚ùå 2s interval still firing
   - ‚ùå Async operations complete and try to update unmounted component
4. **Driver returns** ‚Üí New subscriptions created, OLD ONES STILL RUNNING
5. **Repeat 3-4 times** ‚Üí Memory pressure increases
6. **CRASH** ‚Üí Too many active subscriptions, memory exhausted, or state corruption

### After Fixes:
1. **App opens** ‚Üí Creates RideContext
2. **Driver logs in** ‚Üí Starts location tracking, real-time subscriptions, 2s interval
3. **Driver navigates away** ‚Üí Component unmounts and:
   - ‚úÖ Real-time subscriptions unsubscribed
   - ‚úÖ Location tracking stopped
   - ‚úÖ Interval cleared
   - ‚úÖ `isMountedRef.current = false` set
   - ‚úÖ Any pending async operations check mounted state before setState
4. **Driver returns** ‚Üí Clean slate, new subscriptions created
5. **Repeat indefinitely** ‚Üí No memory leaks, no crashes

## Testing Checklist

To verify these fixes:

### 1. Memory Leak Test
- [ ] Open app and log in
- [ ] Let app run for 5 minutes with notifications coming in
- [ ] Navigate between tabs multiple times
- [ ] App should remain stable, no crashes
- [ ] Check Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Memory doesn't keep growing

### 2. Navigation Test
- [ ] Log in as driver
- [ ] Go online
- [ ] Navigate: Home ‚Üí Rides ‚Üí History ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Home (repeat 10 times)
- [ ] App should remain stable, no warnings in console

### 3. Real-time Subscription Test
- [ ] Go online as driver
- [ ] Send multiple ride requests from customer app
- [ ] Check console logs - should see single subscription handling all events
- [ ] Navigate away and back - old subscriptions should be cleaned up

### 4. Background/Foreground Test
- [ ] Go online as driver
- [ ] Put app in background for 30 seconds
- [ ] Bring back to foreground
- [ ] Send ride request - should work normally
- [ ] Repeat 5 times - app should stay stable

## Additional Improvements Made

### Concurrent Operation Prevention
```typescript
// Prevents multiple loadRides() calls from running simultaneously
if (isLoadingRides) return
```

### Interval Safety
```typescript
// Only runs if component is still mounted
setInterval(() => {
  if (isMountedRef.current) {
    loadRides()
  }
}, 2000)
```

### State Update Safety
```typescript
// Every state update checks if component is mounted
if (isMountedRef.current) {
  setCurrentRide(ride)
  setPendingRides(rides)
  setError(message)
  setLoading(false)
}
```

## Root Causes Summary

1. **Memory Leaks** - Supabase subscriptions not unsubscribed
2. **Race Conditions** - Concurrent async operations on same state
3. **Unmounted Updates** - setState called after component unmounted
4. **Missing Cleanup** - Intervals and subscriptions not cleared on unmount
5. **No Lifecycle Tracking** - No way to know if component is mounted

---

## Expected Results

**Before Fixes:**
- App crashes after 5-10 minutes of use
- Memory usage grows continuously
- Console warnings about unmounted updates
- State corruption causing unexpected behavior

**After Fixes:**
- App stable for hours of continuous use
- Memory usage stays constant
- No console warnings
- Predictable, consistent behavior
- Clean resource management

---

## Monitoring

To monitor app stability going forward:

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   - ‚úÖ Should see "üõë Cleaning up RideContext..." on unmount
   - ‚úÖ Should see "üîå Cleaning up real-time subscriptions"
   - ‚ùå Should NOT see warnings about unmounted components

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - Monitor in Chrome DevTools (for web testing)
   - Memory should stabilize, not continuously grow

3. **Subscription Count:**
   - Check Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Realtime
   - Should see reasonable number of active connections
   - Should not grow with each navigation

---

## Known Remaining TypeScript Errors

The TypeScript errors shown in the build are type annotation issues, NOT crash-causing bugs:
- Missing type annotations (using `any`)
- RPC function types not properly typed
- These don't affect runtime stability

These can be fixed separately without affecting app stability.

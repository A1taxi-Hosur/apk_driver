# RLS Policy Analysis for Trip Completions

## Summary

✅ **All completion tables have proper RLS policies**
✅ **Modal does NOT read from database** (receives data as props)
✅ **Scheduled bookings are readable by assigned drivers**
✅ **System should work correctly**

## Tables & RLS Status

### 1. trip_completions (Regular Rides)
**RLS Enabled:** ✅ Yes

**Policies:**
- ✅ `Drivers can view own trip completions` - Checks `driver_id` against auth.uid()
- ✅ `Customers can view own trip completions` - Checks `customer_id` against auth.uid()
- ✅ `Admins can read all trip completions` - Admin role check
- ✅ `Authenticated users can insert trip completions` - Any authenticated user
- ✅ `Anonymous users can view trip completions` - Public read (anon role)
- ❌ `Trip completions are immutable` - UPDATE blocked
- ❌ `Trip completions cannot be deleted` - DELETE blocked

---

### 2. rental_trip_completions
**RLS Enabled:** ✅ Yes

**Policies:**
- ✅ `Users can view own rental completions` - Checks `customer_id` OR `driver_id` against auth.uid()
  ```sql
  (auth.uid() = customer_id) OR
  (auth.uid() IN (SELECT drivers.user_id FROM drivers WHERE drivers.id = driver_id))
  ```
- ✅ `Drivers can insert rental completions` - Driver can insert if they own the driver_id
  ```sql
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT drivers.user_id FROM drivers WHERE drivers.id = driver_id)
  ```

---

### 3. outstation_trip_completions
**RLS Enabled:** ✅ Yes

**Policies:**
- ✅ `Users can view own outstation completions` - Checks `customer_id` OR `driver_id` against auth.uid()
  ```sql
  (auth.uid() = customer_id) OR
  (auth.uid() IN (SELECT drivers.user_id FROM drivers WHERE drivers.id = driver_id))
  ```
- ✅ `Drivers can insert outstation completions` - Driver can insert if they own the driver_id
  ```sql
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT drivers.user_id FROM drivers WHERE drivers.id = driver_id)
  ```

---

### 4. airport_trip_completions
**RLS Enabled:** ✅ Yes

**Policies:**
- ✅ `Users can view own airport completions` - Checks `customer_id` OR `driver_id` against auth.uid()
  ```sql
  (auth.uid() = customer_id) OR
  (auth.uid() IN (SELECT drivers.user_id FROM drivers WHERE drivers.id = driver_id))
  ```
- ✅ `Drivers can insert airport completions` - Driver can insert if they own the driver_id
  ```sql
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT drivers.user_id FROM drivers WHERE drivers.id = driver_id)
  ```

---

## Data Flow Analysis

### Regular Rides (trip_completions)

**Insert Flow:**
```typescript
// contexts/RideContext.tsx - completeRide()
FareCalculationService.calculateAndStoreTripFare()
  → calculateRegularFare()
  → supabase.rpc('insert_trip_completion', {...})  // Uses RPC to bypass RLS
```

**Read Flow:**
```typescript
// Modal receives data as props - NO database read
```

**RLS Impact:** ✅ **No issues** - Uses RPC function which bypasses RLS for insert

---

### Scheduled Bookings (rental/outstation/airport_trip_completions)

**Insert Flow:**
```typescript
// app/(tabs)/scheduled.tsx - handleCompleteTrip()
FareCalculationService.storeScheduledBookingFareBreakdown()
  → Read: supabase.from('scheduled_bookings').select('*').eq('id', bookingId)
  → Insert: supabase.from('rental_trip_completions').insert({...})
  → Insert: supabase.from('outstation_trip_completions').insert({...})
  → Insert: supabase.from('airport_trip_completions').insert({...})
```

**Read Flow:**
```typescript
// Modal receives data as props - NO database read
```

**RLS Impact Analysis:**

1. **Reading scheduled_bookings:**
   - Policy: `Drivers can view their assigned scheduled bookings`
   - Check: `assigned_driver_id IN (SELECT drivers.id WHERE drivers.user_id = auth.uid())`
   - Result: ✅ **Will work** - Driver is assigned to the booking

2. **Inserting into completion tables:**
   - Policy: `Drivers can insert [type] completions`
   - Check: `auth.uid() IN (SELECT drivers.user_id WHERE drivers.id = driver_id)`
   - Result: ✅ **Will work** - Driver is inserting their own completion

## CustomerTripCompletionModal Data Source

**File:** `/components/CustomerTripCompletionModal.tsx`

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Modal receives ALL data as props (no database queries)
interface CustomerTripCompletionModalProps {
  visible: boolean;
  tripData: {
    distance: number;
    duration: number;
    fareBreakdown: {...};
    pickup_address: string;
    destination_address: string;
    // ... all other fields
  };
  onClose: () => void;
}

// Data is prepared in scheduled.tsx before showing modal:
const tripCompletionData = {
  distance: actualDistanceKm,
  duration: actualDurationMinutes,
  fareBreakdown: fareBreakdown,  // Already calculated
  pickup_address: currentBooking.pickup_address,
  destination_address: currentBooking.destination_address,
  // ... driver details, vehicle details, etc.
};

setCompletionData(tripCompletionData);
setShowCompletionModal(true);
```

**RLS Impact:** ✅ **No issues** - Modal doesn't query database, just displays props

---

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: scheduled_bookings Read Permission
**Location:** `FareCalculationService.storeScheduledBookingFareBreakdown()` line 815

**Current Code:**
```typescript
const { data: booking, error: bookingError } = await supabase
  .from('scheduled_bookings')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', bookingId)
  .single();
```

**RLS Check:**
- Driver must be assigned: `assigned_driver_id` must match driver's ID
- This should work since driver is completing their own booking

**Status:** ✅ **Should work** - Driver is assigned to booking

---

### Issue 2: Completion Table Insert Permission
**Location:** Lines 841-876 (rental), 888-925 (outstation), 937-970 (airport)

**Current Code:**
```typescript
const rentalResult = await supabase
  .from('rental_trip_completions')
  .insert({
    driver_id: driverDetails.driver_id,
    // ...
  })
```

**RLS Check:**
- Policy checks: `auth.uid() IN (SELECT drivers.user_id WHERE drivers.id = driver_id)`
- Driver is inserting completion with their own driver_id

**Status:** ✅ **Should work** - Driver owns the driver_id being inserted

---

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Driver Completes Rental Booking
```
1. Driver accepts rental booking
2. Driver starts trip (OTP verified)
3. GPS tracking runs
4. Driver clicks "Complete Trip"
5. System:
   - ✅ Reads scheduled_bookings (driver is assigned)
   - ✅ Inserts into rental_trip_completions (driver owns driver_id)
   - ✅ Shows modal with calculated data (no DB read)
```

### Test 2: Driver Completes Outstation Booking
```
1. Driver accepts outstation booking
2. Driver starts trip (OTP verified)
3. GPS tracking runs
4. Driver clicks "Complete Trip"
5. System:
   - ✅ Reads scheduled_bookings (driver is assigned)
   - ✅ Inserts into outstation_trip_completions (driver owns driver_id)
   - ✅ Shows modal with calculated data (no DB read)
```

### Test 3: Driver Completes Airport Booking
```
1. Driver accepts airport booking
2. Driver starts trip (OTP verified)
3. GPS tracking runs
4. Driver clicks "Complete Trip"
5. System:
   - ✅ Reads scheduled_bookings (driver is assigned)
   - ✅ Inserts into airport_trip_completions (driver owns driver_id)
   - ✅ Shows modal with calculated data (no DB read)
```

## Conclusion

✅ **All RLS policies are properly configured**
✅ **Modal doesn't query database** - receives data as props
✅ **Driver can read assigned bookings**
✅ **Driver can insert their own completions**
✅ **System should work correctly without RLS issues**

### No Action Required

The RLS policies are correctly set up and should not cause any issues with trip completion modals for rental, outstation, or airport bookings.

### Why This Works:

1. **Modal receives data as props** - No SELECT queries in modal
2. **Booking read is authorized** - Driver is assigned to the booking
3. **Completion insert is authorized** - Driver is inserting their own completion
4. **RLS policies are properly scoped** - Check both customer_id and driver_id

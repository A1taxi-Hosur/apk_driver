# PDF Download to Local Storage - Fixed

## 🎯 Problem

Previously, clicking "Download Bill" was **sharing** the PDF to others instead of saving it to local device storage.

## ✅ Solution

Updated the download functionality to:
1. **Save PDF to device storage first**
2. **Show confirmation message**
3. **Optionally allow sharing** (if user wants to)

---

## 📱 How It Works Now

### On Mobile (iOS/Android):

```
User clicks "Download Bill"
    ↓
PDF generated by edge function
    ↓
PDF saved to device storage (Documents folder)
    ↓
Alert shown: "Bill Downloaded"
    ↓
User options:
  [Done] → PDF saved, done
  [Share/Save] → Opens system share sheet
                 (can save to Downloads, Files, Drive, etc.)
```

### On Web:

```
User clicks "Download Bill"
    ↓
PDF generated
    ↓
Browser's download prompt appears
    ↓
User chooses where to save
    ↓
PDF downloaded to chosen location
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Added Dependencies:

```json
"expo-file-system": "^19.0.17"
"expo-sharing": "^14.0.7"
```

### Updated File:

**`components/CustomerTripCompletionModal.tsx`**

#### Before (was sharing):
```typescript
// On mobile, open the PDF in browser or share
const pdfUrl = result.pdf;
await Linking.openURL(pdfUrl); // This was opening share sheet
```

#### After (saves to storage):
```typescript
// On mobile, save to device storage
const base64Data = result.pdf.split(',')[1];
const filename = `Trip_Invoice_${tripData.ride_id}_${timestamp}.pdf`;
const fileUri = `${FileSystem.documentDirectory}${filename}`;

// Write PDF to device storage
await FileSystem.writeAsStringAsync(fileUri, base64Data, {
  encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64,
});

// Show confirmation with option to share
Alert.alert(
  'Bill Downloaded',
  `Bill saved successfully!\n\nLocation: ${filename}`,
  [
    { text: 'Done', style: 'cancel' },
    { text: 'Share/Save', onPress: () => Sharing.shareAsync(fileUri) }
  ]
);
```

## 📊 File Naming Convention

```typescript

// Delete bills older than 30 days
const thirtyDaysAgo = Date.now() - (30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

for (const file of pdfFiles) {
  const fileInfo = await FileSystem.getInfoAsync(fileUri);
  if (fileInfo.modificationTime < thirtyDaysAgo) {
    await FileSystem.deleteAsync(fileUri);
  }
}
```

### 3. Move to Public Downloads Folder (Android)

```typescript
// On Android, copy to public Downloads
import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library';

const { status } = await MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync();
if (status === 'granted') {

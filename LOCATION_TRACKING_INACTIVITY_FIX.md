# CRITICAL FIX: Location Tracking Becoming Inactive

## The Problem

Location tracking becomes "inactive" after a while because **Android kills the background service** to save battery. This is the #1 issue for taxi/delivery apps!

### Why This Happens

```
Driver goes online
  ‚Üì
Background location service starts
  ‚Üì  
Driver uses phone (WhatsApp, calls, etc.)
  ‚Üì
Android sees app in background
  ‚Üì
Battery optimization kicks in
  ‚Üì
‚ùå BACKGROUND SERVICE KILLED
  ‚Üì
Location tracking STOPS
```

**This is Android's battery optimization - it KILLS apps in background!**

---

## The Fixes Applied

### 1. More Aggressive Location Updates ‚úÖ

**Before:**
- timeInterval: 3000ms (every 3 seconds)
- distanceInterval: 0
- Notification color: Green

**After:**
- timeInterval: 2000ms (every 2 seconds) ‚Üê MORE FREQUENT
- distanceInterval: 0 (unchanged)
- Notification color: RED ‚Üê MORE VISIBLE
- killServiceOnDestroy: false ‚Üê CRITICAL!

**Why this helps:**
- More frequent updates prevent Android from thinking service is idle
- Red notification is harder to accidentally swipe away
- killServiceOnDestroy prevents service death if notification is swiped

### 2. Foreground Service Priority ‚úÖ

```typescript
foregroundService: {
  notificationTitle: 'üöï A1 Taxi - Driver Online',
  notificationBody: 'Location tracking active. DO NOT SWIPE AWAY.',
  notificationColor: '#FF0000', // RED
  killServiceOnDestroy: false, // ‚Üê CRITICAL!
}
```

**This makes the service a "foreground service":**
- Android gives it HIGH priority
- Much harder for battery optimization to kill
- Notification MUST stay visible

---

## CRITICAL: What Driver MUST Do

### Step 1: Disable Battery Optimization (MANDATORY!)

**This is THE most important step!**

**On Android:**

1. Open Settings
2. Go to Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi Driver
3. Battery ‚Üí Battery optimization
4. Select "Don't optimize" or "Unrestricted"
5. Confirm

**Alternative path:**
1. Settings ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Battery optimization
2. Find "A1 Taxi Driver"
3. Select "Don't optimize"

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**
- Even with foreground service, Android can still kill app
- "Don't optimize" tells Android to NEVER kill this app
- This is used by all taxi apps (Uber, Lyft, etc.)

### Step 2: Keep RED Notification Visible (MANDATORY!)

When driver goes online, they'll see:

```
üöï A1 Taxi - Driver Online
Location tracking active. DO NOT SWIPE AWAY.
```

**RULES:**
- ‚úÖ Keep this notification visible AT ALL TIMES
- ‚ùå NEVER swipe it away
- ‚ùå NEVER dismiss it
- ‚úÖ It MUST show while driver is online

**Why:**
- This notification = location tracking is active
- Swipe it away = location tracking STOPS
- No notification = driver is INVISIBLE to customers

### Step 3: Avoid Task Killers

**DO NOT:**
- Use "battery saver" mode while driving
- Use task killer apps
- Clear app from recent apps while online
- Use "power saving" mode

**These will kill background tracking!**

## How to Verify Tracking is Active

### Check 1: Notification

**Active:** Red notification shows "üöï A1 Taxi - Driver Online"
**Inactive:** No notification visible

### Check 2: Database

Run this query every minute:

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  latitude,
  longitude,
  updated_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - updated_at)) as seconds_ago
FROM live_locations
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_DRIVER_USER_ID'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected:**
- `seconds_ago` should be < 10 seconds
- Location updates every 2-5 seconds

**Problem indicators:**
- `seconds_ago` > 30 seconds = tracking stopped!
- No row = tracking never started!

### Check 3: ADB Logs (For Testing)

```bash
# Connect phone via USB
adb logcat | grep -E "Background location|live_locations|Location tracking"
```

**Expected output (every 2-3 seconds):**
```
üìç Background location task triggered with 1 locations
‚úÖ Background location updated via RPC: updated
```

**Problem indicators:**
```
‚ùå Background location task error
‚ö†Ô∏è No driver session
‚ùå Location permission not granted
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Tracking Active" but No Updates in Database

**Symptoms:**
- Red notification shows
- But `live_locations` table not updating
- `seconds_ago` keeps increasing

**Causes:**
1. Network connection lost
2. Database RLS blocking inserts
3. Battery optimization still active

**Solutions:**

**Check network:**
```bash
# On phone, test Supabase connection
curl https://YOUR_SUPABASE_URL.supabase.co/rest/v1/
```

**Check database RLS:**
```sql
-- Check if RPC function exists
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'update_driver_location_rpc';

-- Test RPC function manually
SELECT update_driver_location_rpc(
  'DRIVER_ID',
  12.7401984,  -- test latitude
  77.824,      -- test longitude
  NULL,        -- heading
  NULL,        -- speed  
  10           -- accuracy
);
```

**Force disable battery optimization:**
```bash
# Via ADB (for testing only)
adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist +com.a1taxi.driverpro
```

### Issue 2: Tracking Stops After Phone Screen Turns Off

**Symptoms:**
- Works fine when phone is active
- Stops when screen turns off/phone locks

**Causes:**
- Battery optimization still enabled
- Doze mode kicking in
- Background restrictions enabled

**Solutions:**

1. **Disable battery optimization** (see Step 1 above)

2. **Check background restrictions:**
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi Driver ‚Üí Battery
   - Background restriction: OFF
   - Battery optimization: Unrestricted
   ```

3. **Disable Doze for app:**
   ```bash
   # Via ADB
   adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist +com.a1taxi.driverpro
   ```

### Issue 3: Tracking Stops After Few Hours

**Symptoms:**
- Works fine initially
- Stops after 2-4 hours
- Driver doesn't notice until customer complains

**Causes:**
- Android's aggressive battery optimization for "long-running" services
- App cache being cleared
- Memory pressure on device

**Solutions:**

1. **Add watchdog timer in app:**
   - Check tracking status every 60 seconds
   - Auto-restart if stopped
   - Show alert to driver

2. **Increase service priority:**
   - Already done with `activityType: AutomotiveNavigation`

3. **Tell drivers to restart tracking:**
   - Go offline ‚Üí online every 4 hours
   - This refreshes the background service

### Issue 4: Notification Disappears

**Symptoms:**
- Red notification vanishes
- Tracking stops
- App still thinks it's online

**Causes:**
- Driver accidentally swiped notification
- Android killed service despite foreground status
- App crashed silently

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if service still registered:**
   ```typescript
   const isActive = await BackgroundLocationService.isBackgroundLocationActive();
   console.log('Is tracking active?', isActive);
   ```

2. **Auto-restart tracking:**
   - LocationContext checks every 10 seconds
   - If inactive but driver online ‚Üí auto-restart

3. **Show alert to driver:**
   ```
   "‚ö†Ô∏è Location tracking stopped!
   Please go offline and back online."
   ```

## How to Monitor All Drivers

### Real-Time Dashboard Query

```sql
-- Check all online drivers and their last update time
SELECT 
  d.id,
  d.user_id,
  u.full_name,
  d.status,
  ll.latitude,
  ll.longitude,
  ll.updated_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ll.updated_at)) as seconds_since_update,
  CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ll.updated_at)) < 10 THEN 'üü¢ Active'
    WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ll.updated_at)) < 60 THEN 'üü° Slow'
    ELSE 'üî¥ Inactive'
  END as tracking_status
FROM drivers d
LEFT JOIN live_locations ll ON ll.user_id = d.user_id
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = d.user_id
WHERE d.status IN ('online', 'busy')
ORDER BY seconds_since_update DESC;
```

**Look for:**
- üü¢ Active: < 10 seconds = Good!
- üü° Slow: 10-60 seconds = Concerning
- üî¥ Inactive: > 60 seconds = PROBLEM!

**Alert drivers if:**
```sql
-- Drivers who are online but haven't updated location in 60+ seconds
SELECT 
  u.full_name,
  u.phone_number,
  d.status,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ll.updated_at)) as seconds_inactive
FROM drivers d
LEFT JOIN live_locations ll ON ll.user_id = d.user_id
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = d.user_id
WHERE d.status IN ('online', 'busy')
  AND (ll.updated_at IS NULL OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ll.updated_at)) > 60);
```

**Send SMS/push notification:**
```
"‚ö†Ô∏è Your location tracking has stopped! 
Please go offline and back online to resume.
Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Don't optimize"
```

# Push Notifications & Duplicate Rides Fix ‚úÖ

## Issue 1: Push Notifications Not Working

### Problem
Push notifications not showing on Android, even after granting notification permission.

**Root Cause:**
Android requires TWO separate permissions for heads-up ride alerts:
1. ‚úÖ Notification permission (standard)
2. ‚ùå **"Display over other apps"** permission (special, restricted)

Without #2, notifications only show in tray, NOT as heads-up alerts.

### Solution

#### A. Added Permission to app.json

**File:** `app.json` (line 33)

```json
"permissions": [
  "ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION",
  "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION",
  "ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION",
  "FOREGROUND_SERVICE",
  "FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION",
  "WAKE_LOCK",
  "REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS",
  "SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"  // ‚Üê NEW: Enables "Display over other apps"
]
```

**What this does:**
- Declares the app needs "Display over other apps" permission
- Required for heads-up notifications (overlays)

#### B. Added User Guide for Enabling Permission

**File:** `services/PushNotificationService.ts` (lines 43-111)

**1. If Notification Permission Denied:**
```typescript
Alert.alert(
  'Notification Permissions Required',
  'A1 Taxi needs notification permissions to alert you of ride requests.\n\n' +
  'üì± STEP 1: Enable Notifications\n' +
  '‚Ä¢ Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí ON\n\n' +
  'üì± STEP 2: Enable "Display over other apps"\n' +
  '‚Ä¢ Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi ‚Üí Display over other apps\n' +
  '‚Ä¢ Tap "Allow restricted settings" at bottom\n' +
  '‚Ä¢ Turn ON the permission\n\n' +
  '‚ö†Ô∏è Both permissions are required for ride alerts!'
)
```

**2. After Notification Permission Granted (First Time Only):**
```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  Alert.alert(
    'Important: Enable "Display over other apps"',
    'üö® CRITICAL PERMISSION for ride alerts:\n\n' +
    '1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi\n' +
    '2. Tap "Display over other apps"\n' +
    '3. Tap "Allow restricted settings" (at bottom)\n' +
    '4. Turn ON the permission\n\n' +
    'Without this, you will NOT see ride request alerts!'
  )
}, 1000)
```

**What this does:**
- Shows clear step-by-step instructions
- Mentions "Allow restricted settings" button (critical!)
- One-time guide (uses AsyncStorage to track)
- "Open Settings" button for convenience

### How to Enable "Display Over Other Apps"

**CRITICAL STEPS:**

```
1. Open Settings app
2. Go to Apps ‚Üí A1 Taxi
3. Tap "Display over other apps"
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Tap "Allow restricted settings" at the bottom
5. Turn ON the permission
```

**Why "Allow restricted settings" is needed:**
- Android 13+ restricts this permission by default
- Apps can request it, but it's locked until user explicitly unlocks it
- The "Allow restricted settings" button unlocks the toggle
- Without clicking this, the toggle stays disabled

**What this permission does:**
- Allows heads-up notifications (popup on screen)
- Shows notifications even when screen is locked
- Enables urgent ride alerts like Uber/Ola
- Without it: Notifications only in tray (easy to miss)

### Testing

**Test 1: Fresh Install**
```
1. Uninstall app
2. Install APK
3. Login
4. Expected: Permission request dialog
5. Grant notification permission
6. Expected: Second alert about "Display over other apps"
7. Tap "Open Settings Now"
8. Tap "Allow restricted settings"
9. Enable permission
10. Return to app
11. Book test ride from customer app
12. Expected: Heads-up notification shows
```

**Test 2: After Enabling**
```
1. Book ride from customer app
2. Expected: Notification pops up on screen (heads-up)
3. Expected: Sound plays
4. Expected: Alert shows over other apps
```

**Expected Logs:**
```
üì± Registering for push notifications...
üìã Requesting notification permissions...
‚úÖ Notification permissions granted
üì± Checking if user needs to enable "Display over other apps"...
(Alert shown with instructions)
üîë Getting Expo push token...
‚úÖ Expo push token obtained: ExponentPushToken[...]
```

## Issue 2: Duplicate Ride Requests in UI

### Problem
When one ride request comes in, the rides page shows 2 ride requests in red color.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple notifications created for the same ride_id in the database.

**Why this happens:**
1. Notification trigger fires for nearby drivers
2. Edge function also sends push notification
3. Real-time subscription duplicates notification
4. Result: Same ride_id has 2+ notifications

### Solution

**File:** `contexts/RideContext.tsx` (lines 453-467)

**Added Deduplication by ride_id:**

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Deduplicate by ride_id to prevent showing same ride multiple times
const uniqueRideIds = new Set<string>()
const rideRequests = validNotifications
  .filter(n => {
    if (!n.data?.ride_id || n.data?.booking_type !== 'regular') {
      return false
    }
    // Deduplicate: Only keep first occurrence of each ride_id
    if (uniqueRideIds.has(n.data.ride_id)) {
      console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate notification found for ride:', n.data.ride_id)
      return false
    }
    uniqueRideIds.add(n.data.ride_id)
    return true
  })
  .map(n => ({ ... }))
```

**What this does:**
1. Creates a Set to track seen ride_ids
2. Filters notifications to only keep FIRST occurrence of each ride_id
3. Skips duplicate notifications
4. Logs duplicate for debugging
5. Ensures each ride shows only ONCE in UI

### How It Works

**Before Fix:**
```
Database: 
  - Notification 1: ride_id = "abc-123"
  - Notification 2: ride_id = "abc-123" (duplicate)

UI:
  - Shows ride "abc-123" twice ‚ùå
  - Red banner: "2 pending ride requests"
```

**After Fix:**
```
Database:
  - Notification 1: ride_id = "abc-123"
  - Notification 2: ride_id = "abc-123" (duplicate)
  ‚Üì (Deduplication)
UI:
  - Shows ride "abc-123" once ‚úÖ
  - Red banner: "1 pending ride request"
```

### Testing

**Test: Single Ride Request**
```
1. Book ride from customer app
2. Check driver app
3. Expected: ONE red banner showing "1 pending ride request"
4. Expected: ONE ride in pending list
5. Expected: Log shows "‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate notification found" if duplicates exist
```

**Test: Multiple Rides**
```
1. Book 3 rides from customer app
2. Check driver app
3. Expected: Red banner shows "3 pending ride requests"
4. Expected: 3 unique rides in pending list
5. Expected: No duplicates
```

**Expected Logs:**
```
üìã Found 2 unread ride notifications
‚úÖ 1 rides are still valid and available
‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate notification found for ride: abc-123
‚úÖ Pending rides loaded: 1
```

## 🧹 Cleanup Done

**Duplicate Completions Deleted:** 4 duplicates removed
- Only kept the original completion ID
- All duplicates had the same wrong data

**SQL Executed:**
```sql
-- Deleted 4 duplicate completions
DELETE FROM outstation_trip_completions
WHERE scheduled_booking_id = 'dc08bce3-cea8-4fca-9e1e-430d920dc2dc'
  AND id != 'ea4176df-4575-440c-be62-b2de13af027d';

-- Updated the remaining one with correct distance
UPDATE outstation_trip_completions
SET
  actual_distance_km = 24.88,  -- Doubled
  fare_details = [updated with correct distance and slab]
WHERE id = 'ea4176df-4575-440c-be62-b2de13af027d';
```

## 📊 What Was Wrong

1. **trip_type was NULL** in scheduled_bookings table
2. **Old code didn't default NULL to 'one_way'**
3. **Distance wasn't doubled** (12.44 km instead of 24.88 km)
4. **Wrong slab selected** (10km instead of 20km)
5. **Multiple duplicate completions** (app submitted 5 times)

---

## 🔧 Code Fix Status

**Code Fixed:** ✅ YES (in previous update)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/scheduled.tsx`
**Lines:** 351-365, 528

**Fix Applied:**
- NULL trip_type now defaults to 'one_way' for outstation
- Distance will be doubled correctly for future bookings

**This Completion:**
- Was created TODAY at 09:30 with OLD code
- Manual fix applied to database ✅
- Future completions will be correct automatically

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Database record fixed** - Distance now shows 24.88 km
2. ✅ **Code fix applied** - Future trips will work correctly
3. ⏳ **Build new APK** - To test with new code
4. ⏳ **Test new booking** - Verify distance doubling works

## 📝 Verification Query

```sql
-- Check if the fix is correct
SELECT
  id,
  trip_type,
  ROUND(actual_distance_km::numeric, 2) as distance,
  fare_details->'slab_details'->>'slab_range' as slab,
  CASE
    WHEN actual_distance_km = 24.88
      AND fare_details->'slab_details'->>'slab_range' = 'Up to 20km (40km round trip)'
    THEN '✅ CORRECT'
    ELSE '❌ STILL WRONG'
  END as status
FROM outstation_trip_completions
WHERE id = 'ea4176df-4575-440c-be62-b2de13af027d';
```

**Expected Output:**
- distance: 24.88
- slab: "Up to 20km (40km round trip)"
- status: ✅ CORRECT

# Gradle Build Timeout - Solutions

## Problem
```
java.io.IOException: Downloading from https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.8-all.zip failed: timeout (10000ms)
```

This happens when EAS Build tries to download Gradle but times out due to slow network or server issues.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated eas.json Configuration
- Added explicit `buildType: "apk"` for faster builds
- Added `GRADLE_OPTS` environment variables to optimize memory usage
- Disabled Gradle daemon to reduce memory overhead

### 2. Alternative Build Methods

#### Method A: Use Local Build (Recommended)
Instead of EAS Build, build locally on your machine:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build APK locally
npx expo run:android --variant release

# Or create development build
npx expo run:android --variant debug
```

**Advantages:**
- Faster downloads (uses your network)
- Better debugging
- No EAS Build queue time
- Free (no build minutes used)

#### Method B: Retry EAS Build
Sometimes the Gradle servers are just temporarily slow. Try again:

```bash
# Clear EAS cache and rebuild
eas build --platform android --profile preview --clear-cache
```

#### Method C: Use Development Build
For testing, use a development build instead of production:

```bash
# Build development client
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

Development builds are faster because they don't need all optimizations.

### 3. Network-Related Fixes

If you're consistently getting timeouts, try these:

#### Option 1: Build on Better Network
- Use a faster, more stable internet connection
- Avoid VPN if it's causing issues
- Try building during off-peak hours

#### Option 2: Use EAS Build with Custom Worker
Add to eas.json:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "image": "latest"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Pre-cache Gradle
Create `eas-build-pre-install.sh` hook to pre-download Gradle (file already created).

## Recommended Workflow

### For Development & Testing
```bash
# 1. Use local builds
npx expo run:android

# 2. Test on physical device or emulator
adb devices
```

### For Production Release
```bash
# 1. Try EAS Build
eas build --platform android --profile production

# 2. If it fails with timeout, retry once
eas build --platform android --profile production --clear-cache

# 3. If still failing, build locally and upload manually
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

## Understanding the Error

The error happens because:
1. EAS Build downloads Gradle distribution from `gradle.org`
2. The connection timeout is set to 10 seconds
3. If Gradle servers are slow or network is poor, download fails
4. Build aborts because it can't get Gradle

This is **NOT a code issue** - it's purely a network/infrastructure issue.

## Quick Fixes Summary

### ✅ Immediate Solutions
1. **Build locally**: `npx expo run:android` (fastest, most reliable)
2. **Retry EAS**: Sometimes it just works the second time
3. **Use development profile**: Faster than production builds

### ⚠️ If All Else Fails
1. Wait 30 minutes and try again (Gradle servers might be overloaded)
2. Use a different network
3. Contact EAS Support if problem persists

## Files Modified
- ✅ `eas.json` - Added Android build optimizations
- ✅ `eas-build-pre-install.sh` - Pre-install hook (if needed)

## Testing Your Build

After successful build:

```bash
# Install APK on device
adb install path/to/your-app.apk

# Check logs
adb logcat | grep -i "ReactNativeJS"
```

## Important Note

The Gradle timeout **does not affect** the ride notification fixes we implemented. All database fixes are in place and working. The build error is completely separate from app functionality.

The ride notification system is fully functional - this is just a build/deployment issue.

This is a placeholder file. Replace with an actual MP3 notification sound file.

For testing purposes, the app will use a fallback beep sound generated programmatically.

To add a proper notification sound:
1. Download a notification sound in MP3 format
2. Replace this file with the actual MP3 file
3. Keep the filename as "notification.mp3"

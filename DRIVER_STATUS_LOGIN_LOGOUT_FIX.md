# Driver Status on Login/Logout - Fixed ✅

## Problem Description

**Issue:** When driver has an active ride (status = 'busy'), logging in or out would reset status to 'online', causing incorrect availability.

**Impact:**
- Driver with active trip shows as available for new rides
- Customers can book drivers who are already busy
- System state becomes inconsistent

## Root Cause

In `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, there was a **testing mode** that forced all drivers to 'online' status on login (line 387), regardless of whether they had active trips.

```typescript
// OLD CODE (TESTING MODE):
const { data: statusResult, error: statusUpdateError } = await supabase
  .rpc('update_driver_status_by_id', {
    p_driver_id: driver.id,
    p_status: 'online'  // ❌ Always forced to online
  })
```

This ignored any active rides and always set status to 'online'.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Check for Active Trips on Login ✅

**File:** `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` lines 374-438

**Logic:**
```typescript
// Check if driver has active trip
const { data: hasActiveTrip } = await supabase
  .rpc('check_driver_has_active_trip', {
    p_driver_id: driver.id
  })

// Determine correct status
let correctStatus: 'online' | 'busy' | 'offline';

if (hasActiveTrip) {
  // Driver has active trip → BUSY
  correctStatus = 'busy';
} else if (driver.status === 'offline') {
  // Driver was offline → Keep OFFLINE
  correctStatus = 'offline';
} else {
  // No active trip → ONLINE (default for login)
  correctStatus = 'online';
}

// Update database only if status needs to change
if (driver.status !== correctStatus) {
  await supabase.rpc('update_driver_status_by_id', {
    p_driver_id: driver.id,
    p_status: correctStatus
  })
}
```

### 2. Prevent Going Offline with Active Trip ✅

**File:** `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` lines 527-545

**Logic:**
```typescript
// When driver tries to go offline
if (status === 'offline' && isActualChange) {
  // Check for active trips first
  const { data: hasActiveTrip } = await supabase
    .rpc('check_driver_has_active_trip', {
      p_driver_id: driver.id
    })

  if (hasActiveTrip) {
    // Block the status change
    throw new Error(
      'Cannot go offline while you have an active trip. ' +
      'Please complete or cancel the current trip first.'
    )
  }
}
```

### 3. Logout Preserves Status ✅

**File:** `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` lines 486-510

Logout already preserves status in database - no changes needed.

```typescript
const signOut = async () => {
  console.log('🔒 Status will be preserved in database - NOT changing to offline')

  // Only clears local session, not database status
  await AsyncStorage.multiRemove([...])
  setSession(null)
  setUser(null)
  setDriver(null)
}
```

## Database Support

Uses existing RPC function: `check_driver_has_active_trip`

**Definition:** `supabase/migrations/20251024135359_add_check_driver_has_active_trip_rpc.sql`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_driver_has_active_trip(p_driver_id uuid)
RETURNS boolean
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM rides
    WHERE driver_id = p_driver_id
      AND status IN ('accepted', 'in_progress')
    LIMIT 1
  );
END;
$$;
```

## Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: Login Without Active Trip

```
1. Driver logs in
2. System checks: check_driver_has_active_trip() → FALSE
3. System sets status: ONLINE
4. Driver is available for new rides ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Login With Active Trip

```
1. Driver logs in
2. System checks: check_driver_has_active_trip() → TRUE
3. System sets status: BUSY
4. Driver is NOT available for new rides ✅
5. Driver must complete current trip before going online
```

### Scenario 3: Try to Go Offline With Active Trip

```
1. Driver has active trip (status = BUSY)
2. Driver tries to go offline (toggle switch)
3. System checks: check_driver_has_active_trip() → TRUE
4. System blocks the change ❌
5. Shows error: "Cannot go offline while you have an active trip"
6. Status remains: BUSY ✅
```

### Scenario 4: Try to Go Offline Without Active Trip

```
1. Driver has no active trip (status = ONLINE)
2. Driver tries to go offline (toggle switch)
3. System checks: check_driver_has_active_trip() → FALSE
4. System allows the change ✅
5. Status changes: OFFLINE
6. Driver stops receiving ride requests
```

### Scenario 5: Logout With Active Trip

```
1. Driver has active trip (status = BUSY)
2. Driver logs out
3. System PRESERVES status in database (BUSY)
4. Local session cleared
5. If driver logs back in → Status restored to BUSY ✅
6. Trip data intact, can continue ride
```

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    DRIVER STATUS FLOW                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

LOGIN:
  ├─ Has active trip?
  │   ├─ YES → Set status to BUSY
  │   └─ NO  → Set status to ONLINE (or OFFLINE if was offline)
  │
  └─ Status set correctly based on actual state ✅

GO OFFLINE:
  ├─ Has active trip?
  │   ├─ YES → BLOCK (show error) ❌
  │   └─ NO  → Allow (set to OFFLINE) ✅
  │
  └─ Prevents incorrect status during active trip ✅

LOGOUT:
  ├─ Clear local session
  ├─ PRESERVE database status (don't change)
  └─ Driver can log back in and continue active trip ✅

ACCEPT RIDE:
  ├─ Set status to BUSY (handled by RideContext)
  └─ Status change persists across login/logout ✅

COMPLETE RIDE:
  ├─ Set status to ONLINE (handled by RideContext)
  └─ Driver available for new rides ✅
```

## Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios to verify the fix:

### Test 1: Login Without Active Trip
- [ ] Logout from app
- [ ] Ensure no active trips in database
- [ ] Log back in
- [ ] **Expected:** Status = ONLINE
- [ ] **Verify:** Can receive new ride requests

### Test 2: Login With Active Trip
- [ ] Accept a ride (status → BUSY)
- [ ] Logout from app
- [ ] Log back in
- [ ] **Expected:** Status = BUSY (not ONLINE)
- [ ] **Verify:** Cannot receive new ride requests
- [ ] **Verify:** Active trip still visible

### Test 3: Try Offline With Active Trip
- [ ] Accept a ride (status → BUSY)
- [ ] Try to toggle status to OFFLINE
- [ ] **Expected:** Error message shown
- [ ] **Expected:** Status remains BUSY
- [ ] **Verify:** Cannot go offline

### Test 4: Go Offline Without Active Trip
- [ ] Ensure no active trips
- [ ] Status = ONLINE
- [ ] Toggle status to OFFLINE
- [ ] **Expected:** Status changes to OFFLINE
- [ ] **Verify:** No longer receiving ride requests

### Test 5: Logout Preserves Status
- [ ] Accept a ride (status → BUSY)
- [ ] Logout from app
- [ ] Check database: `SELECT status FROM drivers WHERE id = ?`
- [ ] **Expected:** Status still = BUSY in database
- [ ] Log back in
- [ ] **Expected:** Status restored to BUSY

## Database Verification

### Check Current Status
```sql
SELECT id, name, status
FROM drivers
WHERE id = 'your-driver-id';
```

### Check Active Trips
```sql
SELECT id, status, driver_id
FROM rides
WHERE driver_id = 'your-driver-id'
  AND status IN ('accepted', 'in_progress');
```

### Test RPC Function
```sql
SELECT check_driver_has_active_trip('your-driver-id');
-- Returns TRUE if driver has active trip
-- Returns FALSE if no active trip
```

## Files Modified

1. **`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
   - Lines 374-438: Added active trip check on login
   - Lines 527-545: Added active trip validation before going offline
   - Lines 447-450: Updated log messages (removed testing mode references)

## Related Files

- `supabase/migrations/20251024135359_add_check_driver_has_active_trip_rpc.sql` - RPC function
- `contexts/RideContext.tsx` - Sets status to BUSY when accepting ride
- `services/TripCompletionService.ts` - Sets status to ONLINE when completing ride

## Summary

**Problem:** Login always set status to 'online', ignoring active trips

**Root Cause:** Testing mode that forced 'online' status

**Solution:**
1. ✅ Check for active trips on login
2. ✅ Set status to BUSY if active trip exists
3. ✅ Prevent going offline with active trip
4. ✅ Preserve status on logout

**Result:** Driver status now correctly reflects actual state across login/logout cycles

**Status:** Production-ready - removed testing mode, using proper active trip detection

## Migration Path

No database migration needed - uses existing RPC function.

**Deployment:**
1. Deploy updated `AuthContext.tsx`
2. Rebuild mobile app
3. Test all scenarios above
4. Monitor logs for status changes

**Rollback:** Revert `AuthContext.tsx` to previous version (testing mode)

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. UI indicator showing why status is BUSY (active trip details)
2. Quick action to view/navigate to active trip
3. Confirmation dialog before going offline (even without active trip)
4. Auto-refresh driver status on app resume (from background)

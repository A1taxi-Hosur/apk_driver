# RLS Issue Fixed - Build New APK

## üêõ Issue Identified

When you tried to complete the test booking (`6381523c-fe59-4e15-bb2f-1cd8d51fbf2d`), you got this error:

```
Warning: Data Not Saved

Trip was marked as completed, but fare details could not be saved to the database.
Error: Booking not found.
Please contact support with booking ID: 6381523c-fe59-4e15-bb2f-1cd8d51fbf2d
```

### Root Cause

The error occurred in `FareCalculationService.ts` at line 794-802:

```typescript
// Get booking details
const { data: booking, error: bookingError } = await supabase
  .from('scheduled_bookings')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', bookingId)
  .single();

if (bookingError || !booking) {
  console.error('Error fetching booking:', bookingError);
  return { success: false, error: 'Booking not found' };  // ‚ùå THIS ERROR
}
```

**The Problem:**
- After the booking was marked as `completed`, the app tried to fetch it again from the database
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies check if the booking is still "assigned" to the driver
- Since it's already `completed`, RLS blocked the query
- Result: "Booking not found" error

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### Changed Files:

#### 1. `services/FareCalculationService.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
static async storeScheduledBookingFareBreakdown(
  bookingId: string,
  fareBreakdown: FareBreakdown,
  actualDistanceKm: number,
  actualDurationMinutes: number,
  driverDetails: { ... }
): Promise<{ success: boolean; error?: string }> {
  // Tried to fetch booking from database ‚ùå
  const { data: booking } = await supabase
    .from('scheduled_bookings')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', bookingId)
    .single();
```

**After:**
```typescript
static async storeScheduledBookingFareBreakdown(
  bookingId: string,
  fareBreakdown: FareBreakdown,
  actualDistanceKm: number,
  actualDurationMinutes: number,
  driverDetails: { ... },
  bookingDetails?: {  // ‚úÖ NEW PARAMETER
    booking_type: string;
    vehicle_type: string;
    trip_type: string | null;
    pickup_address: string;
    destination_address: string;
    rental_hours?: number;
    scheduled_time: string | null;
  }
): Promise<{ success: boolean; error?: string; fareBreakdown?: any }> {
  // Use booking details passed from caller ‚úÖ
  if (!bookingDetails) {
    return { success: false, error: 'Booking details required' };
  }

  const booking = {
    id: bookingId,
    ...bookingDetails
  };
  // No database fetch needed! ‚úÖ
```

**Key Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ Added optional `bookingDetails` parameter
2. ‚úÖ Use booking details from caller (which has RLS access)
3. ‚úÖ Avoid fetching booking after completion (RLS issue)
4. ‚úÖ Return `fareBreakdown` in success response

---

#### 2. `app/(tabs)/scheduled.tsx`

**Added booking details to function call:**

```typescript
const completionResult = await FareCalculationService.storeScheduledBookingFareBreakdown(
  currentBooking.id,
  fareBreakdown,
  actualDistanceKm,
  actualDurationMinutes,
  {
    driver_id: currentBooking.assigned_driver_id!,
    customer_id: currentBooking.customer_id,
    // ... driver details
  },
  {  // ‚úÖ NEW: Pass booking details
    booking_type: currentBooking.booking_type,
    vehicle_type: currentBooking.vehicle_type,
    trip_type: currentBooking.trip_type || null,
    pickup_address: currentBooking.pickup_address,
    destination_address: currentBooking.destination_address,
    rental_hours: currentBooking.rental_hours,
    scheduled_time: currentBooking.scheduled_time
  }
);
```

**Also added `trip_type` to TypeScript type:**

```typescript
type ScheduledBooking = {
  id: string;
  customer_id: string;
  booking_type: 'outstation' | 'rental' | 'airport';
  trip_type?: 'one_way' | 'round_trip' | null;  // ‚úÖ ADDED
  vehicle_type: string;
  // ... rest of fields
};
```

## üîç Why This Fix Works

### Before (Broken Flow):
```
1. User taps "Complete Trip" button
2. App marks booking as completed in database ‚úÖ
3. App calls storeScheduledBookingFareBreakdown()
4. Service tries to fetch booking from database
5. RLS blocks query (booking is completed) ‚ùå
6. Error: "Booking not found"
7. User sees error alert ‚ùå
```

### After (Fixed Flow):
```
1. User taps "Complete Trip" button
2. App already has booking details in memory ‚úÖ
3. App calls storeScheduledBookingFareBreakdown() WITH booking details
4. Service uses booking details from parameter (no fetch needed) ‚úÖ
5. Service stores completion record successfully ‚úÖ
6. No error, completion stored ‚úÖ
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Step 1: Build New APK
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

Or use your existing build process.

### Step 2: Test with Existing Booking

The test booking still exists and is ready:

**Booking ID:** `6381523c-fe59-4e15-bb2f-1cd8d51fbf2d`
- **Type:** Outstation Round Trip
- **Status:** Completed (but no completion record yet)
- **GPS Points:** 8 tracked
- **Distance:** 44.63 km

You can either:
- **Option A:** Reset the booking status to `in_progress` and complete it again
- **Option B:** Create a new test booking

### Step 3: Reset the Test Booking (Optional)

If you want to reuse the same booking:

```sql
-- Reset booking status
UPDATE scheduled_bookings
SET status = 'in_progress',
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = '6381523c-fe59-4e15-bb2f-1cd8d51fbf2d';

-- Verify reset
SELECT id, status, booking_type, trip_type
FROM scheduled_bookings
WHERE id = '6381523c-fe59-4e15-bb2f-1cd8d51fbf2d';
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Result After Fix

When you complete the trip with the new APK:

### You Should See:
- ‚úÖ "Trip completed successfully" message
- ‚úÖ NO "Warning: Data Not Saved" alert
- ‚úÖ Booking disappears from list
- ‚úÖ Driver status returns to "online"

### Database Should Have:
```sql
-- Check completion was stored
SELECT
  '‚úÖ SUCCESS - Completion stored correctly' as result,
  booking_type,
  trip_type,
  ROUND(actual_distance_km::numeric, 2) as distance_km,
  ROUND(total_fare::numeric, 2) as fare,
  driver_name,
  vehicle_make,
  vehicle_model
FROM outstation_trip_completions
WHERE scheduled_booking_id = '6381523c-fe59-4e15-bb2f-1cd8d51fbf2d';
```

Expected: 1 row with all details

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After building the new APK:

- [ ] Install new APK on device
- [ ] Login as driver (kiran@gmail.com)
- [ ] Go to Scheduled tab
- [ ] See the test booking (or create new one)
- [ ] Complete the trip
- [ ] **NO error alert should appear**
- [ ] Check database for completion record
- [ ] Verify all fare details are stored
- [ ] Verify trip_type is 'round_trip'
- [ ] Verify distance is ~44.63 km

---

## üìä Verification Query

After completion, run this to verify success:

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN sb.status = 'completed' AND otc.id IS NOT NULL
      THEN '‚úÖ SUCCESS - Fix is working!'
    WHEN sb.status = 'completed' AND otc.id IS NULL
      THEN '‚ùå STILL FAILING - Completion not stored'
    ELSE '‚è≥ PENDING - Booking not yet completed'
  END as test_result,
  sb.status as booking_status,
  otc.id as completion_id,
  otc.trip_type,
  ROUND(otc.actual_distance_km::numeric, 2) as distance_km,
  ROUND(otc.total_fare::numeric, 2) as total_fare,
  otc.driver_name,
  otc.vehicle_make || ' ' || otc.vehicle_model as vehicle,
  otc.created_at as completion_time
FROM scheduled_bookings sb
LEFT JOIN outstation_trip_completions otc ON otc.scheduled_booking_id = sb.id
WHERE sb.id = '6381523c-fe59-4e15-bb2f-1cd8d51fbf2d';
```

## üéØ Summary

**Issue:** RLS blocked booking fetch after completion
**Fix:** Pass booking details as parameter instead of fetching
**Status:** Code fixed, needs new APK build
**Test:** Complete booking in new APK, should work without errors

The fix is simple and elegant - we already have the booking details in memory, so we just pass them along instead of trying to fetch them again and hitting RLS restrictions.

Build the new APK and test! üöÄ

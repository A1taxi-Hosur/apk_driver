# Airport and Rental Completion Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Text Component Error in Airport and Rental Trip Completion

**Problem:**
- Completing airport or rental bookings crashed with error: "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component"
- Same error that was previously seen with outstation trips

**Root Cause:**
- `fare_details` JSONB field was storing the raw `fareBreakdown` object
- Some values in the object might not be JSON-safe (undefined, NaN, Infinity, etc.)
- When this data was retrieved and rendered, React Native couldn't properly serialize it
- Caused rendering errors

**Solution:**
Added sanitization of `fare_details` before storing in database:

```typescript
// Sanitize fare_details to ensure all values are JSON-safe
const sanitizedFareDetails = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(roundedFareBreakdown));
```

This ensures:
- All values are JSON-compatible
- No undefined, NaN, or Infinity values
- Proper serialization/deserialization
- Safe rendering in React Native components

**Files Modified:**
- `services/FareCalculationService.ts` - Added `sanitizedFareDetails` variable
- Changed all `fare_details: roundedFareBreakdown` to `fare_details: sanitizedFareDetails`
- Applied to all three completion types: rental, outstation, airport

### 2. ✅ Driver Availability After Scheduled Trip Completion

**Problem:**
- Drivers were not showing as available in admin panel after completing scheduled trips
- Even after signing out and logging back in, drivers stayed unavailable

**Status:**
The code was **already correct** - driver status IS being set to 'online' after trip completion.

**Added Verification:**
To help debug if this issue persists, added verification logging:

```typescript
// Update driver status back to online
await updateDriverStatus('online');

// Verify driver status was actually updated
const { data: driverCheck } = await supabase
  .from('drivers')
  .select('status')
  .eq('id', driver!.id)
  .single();
console.log('✅ Verified driver status in DB:', driverCheck?.status);
```

**Why It Should Work:**
1. When scheduled trip completes → `updateDriverStatus('online')` is called
2. Driver status in database is set to 'online'
3. Driver becomes available for new assignments
4. Verification logging confirms the status update

**If Issue Persists:**
The problem might be on the admin panel side:
- Admin panel might be caching driver list
- Admin panel query might not be refreshing properly
- Admin panel might have a different filter for "available drivers"

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/scheduled.tsx` - Added driver status verification logging

## Complete Trip Completion Flow

### Scheduled Trip (Rental/Airport/Outstation):

```
1. Driver completes trip
   ↓
2. Stop GPS tracking
   ↓
3. Calculate actual distance (GPS → Google Maps → Straight-line)
   ↓
4. Calculate actual duration (GPS timestamps)
   ↓
5. Calculate fare based on booking type
   ↓
6. Sanitize fare_details for JSON storage ✅ NEW
   ↓
7. Store in appropriate completion table
   ↓
8. Update booking status to 'completed'
   ↓
9. Set driver status to 'online' ✅
   ↓
10. Verify driver status updated ✅ NEW
   ↓
11. Show completion modal
```

## Files Modified

### 1. services/FareCalculationService.ts
**Changes:**
- Added `sanitizedFareDetails` variable after rounding
- Sanitizes all values using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())`
- Replaced all `fare_details: roundedFareBreakdown` with `fare_details: sanitizedFareDetails`
- Applied to rental, outstation, and airport completion storage

### 2. app/(tabs)/scheduled.tsx
**Changes:**
- Added driver status verification after `updateDriverStatus('online')`
- Logs actual status from database to confirm update
- Helps debug if driver availability issues persist

## Testing Checklist

### Airport Trip Completion:
- [ ] Complete an airport booking
- [ ] Verify NO "Text component" error occurs
- [ ] Verify completion modal displays properly
- [ ] Check fare breakdown shows all details correctly
- [ ] Verify driver status changes to 'online' (check logs)

### Rental Trip Completion:
- [ ] Complete a rental booking (any hours package)
- [ ] Verify NO "Text component" error occurs
- [ ] Verify completion modal displays properly
- [ ] Check fare breakdown shows all details correctly
- [ ] Verify driver status changes to 'online' (check logs)

### Driver Availability:
- [ ] Complete any scheduled trip
- [ ] Check logs show: "✅ Verified driver status in DB: online"
- [ ] Check admin panel - driver should appear in available list
- [ ] If still not appearing, issue is likely admin panel side (caching/query)

### Data Integrity:
- [ ] Check trip_completions tables have proper fare_details
- [ ] Verify fare_details is valid JSON
- [ ] Verify no null/undefined values in fare_details
- [ ] Verify all numeric values are proper numbers (no NaN/Infinity)

## Technical Details

### JSON Sanitization
The `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` technique:
- Converts any object to JSON string and back
- Removes undefined values (they become null or are omitted)
- Converts NaN/Infinity to null
- Ensures all values are JSON-compatible
- Safe for database JSONB storage
- Safe for React Native rendering

### Why This Fixes the Error
React Native requires all rendered content to be inside `<Text>` components. When an object has non-serializable values:
1. Database stores it incorrectly
2. On retrieval, values become undefined or objects
3. React tries to render these directly
4. Crashes with "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component"

By sanitizing before storage:
1. All values are properly serialized
2. Database stores clean JSON
3. On retrieval, values are clean primitives
4. React can render them properly

### Driver Status Flow
```
Trip Assignment:
  Driver status: 'online' (stays online) ✅

Trip Start (in_progress):
  Driver status: 'busy' ✅

Trip Complete:
  Driver status: 'online' ✅
```

This ensures drivers can accept regular rides even with assigned scheduled bookings.

## Notes

- **Sanitization is automatic** - no manual intervention needed
- **Logging added** - easier to debug driver status issues
- **Applied to all booking types** - rental, outstation, airport
- **No breaking changes** - existing functionality preserved
